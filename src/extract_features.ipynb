(DS) is a wargame covering the Asia/Pacific Theater of World War II from 1937 to V-J Day. Players command the Axis, Soviet, and Western factions. DS is the sister game to Totaler Krieg! (TK), which covers the European Theater. The two may be played together as a combined game called Axis Empires (AE). Rulebook Structure Design Note: Don't let the length of the rulebook intimidate you. First, you won't need to memorize the whole thing to play, as it's been written so you can look up the rules as you go. Also, the book contains many clarifications, examples, and design notes that appear in gray text boxes just like this one. These should help explain things as you read. If this is your first time playing DS, we ve come up with some training scenarios that will help you learn as you play. Stop here for now and read Playing DS for the First Time in the scenario book. This is the DS Living Rules rulebook. Text that appears in red ink (such as you see here) indicates an item that has been corrected or changed since the published DS rulebook. The DS rulebook is divided into several sections: Introduction: That's the section you re reading now. Game Components: A list of what comes with the game and what the pieces mean. Core Game Mechanics Sections 0 - 7: These rules define the mechanics you will perform during the course of a Game Turn. Not all rules are performed every Game Turn. For ease of reference, rules 0 through 7 are presented in the same numerical order that rules are performed in during the Sequence of Play. Example: if you are playing Step 5 of the Sequence of Play (Reserve Movement), you ll find Rules Section 5 in this book directly corresponds to that step. Housekeeping Rules Sections 8 13: These are rules that apply throughout the game, but do not fall strictly within the Sequence of Play . Look-Up Rules Sections 14 16: These rules explain the effects of specific markers, Political Events and Conditional Events that may occur. rules re called Look-Up rules because you should look rules up as you play. Clarification: Look-up events are often italicized and crossreferenced when rules appear, to help you find rules quicker. How to Read the rules Design Note: Please don't ignore this section we know you can read and mean no insult. We just want to clarify some of the vernacular before we go any further. While reading the rules, do not infer or imagine more to a rule than is stated in rule . When in doubt, interpret strictly. Treat any game event that is impossible to fulfill given current game conditions as a No Result. That is, nothing happens and the players continue play. Example: An event instructs a player to remove a Policy marker in a Posture Box, but there is no Policy marker in Box at that time. So just ignore that instruction. If an option card provides instructions based on a certain die roll result, and that card doesn't list what happens if that result does not occur, then the event is treated as a No Result. Example: The Conditional Event for Western card 17 Oil Embargo instructs you to count the Japanese markers in the Ceded Lands Box and roll one die. The card says: If the Result is less than or equal to the count, apply Military Aid. Result does not say what happens if you roll greater than the count so the default applies, which is to treat default as No Result. Most rules state items in the singular form. For example, a Japanese ground unit. Unless a specific number is cited, the rule applies from one to any number of the stated item. Clarification: In other words, a doesn't mean just one. When we say one, that's when we mean a single item. Can or cannot indicates whether or not an action is allowed. If indicates that as long as the criteria are true, then the specified effect and/or restriction described applies. If the listed criteria are not true, then what follows does not apply. May indicates the player has the option to do something; thus, player has the choice to perform an action, player is not forced to do so and may treat the result as No Result instead. Must indicates the player has no choice; that action must be performed unless otherwise prohibited or impossible to do given current game circumstances. If the player is presented a list of options that player must select from, player must select an option that can be performed. Clarification: You cannot avoid a bad event by picking an option that is impossible to fulfill and then claim a No Result. A country's name indicates the stated item that follows must belong only to that country . Example: US ground unit refers to any ground unit belonging to the US only and not any country belonging to the Western faction. A faction's name indicates the stated item that follows must belong to that faction . Example: Western Air units refers to any Air unit belonging to any country aligned with the Western faction. A note about TK, DS, and AE: As much as possible, these three games all use the same rules. Where there are exceptions, exceptions will be noted as follows: Rules and counters that are not used in the AE combined game i. that apply to DS only will be preceded by an asterisk. Rules that apply only to the AE combined game will be preceded by a symbol. Rules that are handled differently in DS than Rules are in TK are preceded by a triangle. When you are playing AE , be sure to use the section that applies to the map in question. Design Note: If you already know how to play TK , you pretty much already know how to play DS but look for the asterisks and triangles to see the important differences. Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 4 Glossary Design Note: Even if you do not like reading definitions, we recommend you give this list a glance. Like How to Read the Rules above, list will help you understand the game better. Particularly important terms are underlined. If you forget what these terms mean, refer back here for the definition. Active: A Minor Country that is not Neutral or Conquered. Major Countries are always considered active. Air Base: A Land hex containing a City, Port, Road, or Rail, and a supplied ground unit, Detachment marker, or Logistics marker. Exception: A hex containing an enemy Air unit does not have an Air Base. Clarification: When a Road or Rail hex is used as an Air Base , that Road/Rail does not have to be the one used to trace a supply line. Example: A supplied Japanese ground unit is in hex w5422, a Road hex. This hex may serve as an Air Base even if hex traces a supply line from w5522 back along the road to Hailar (w5625), then along the rails back to Dairen, and eventually back to Japan. Allied: This indicates something related to either the Soviet and Western factions. Example: Allied ground unit refers to any ground unit belonging to any country aligned with the Soviet or Western faction. Beachhead Hexside: The hexside faced by the arrow on a Beachhead marker. Units may move and attack across a Beachhead Hexside . Blitz-enabled: If a faction has a Blitz or Totsugeki marker on the map, then all friendly units within two hexes of that marker are said to be Blitz-enabled. Clarification: That includes all friendly units in the hex containing the Blitz marker That . If the Axis faction has an SNLF Beachhead-0 marker on the map , any friendly unit or marker within the hex containing that SNLF Beachhead-0 marker is Blitz-enabled. Clarification: SNLF Beachhead-0 markers do not have a Blitz range like Blitz or Totsugeki markers. Border: A Country or Dependent shares a Border with another Country or Dependent if there is at least one Border Hexside between the two (see the Terrain Key). A Border Hexside can be exclusively across a Strait or All-Sea hexside. Example: Indochina (a French Dependent) and Kiangsu share a Border, as do Malaya (a British Dependent) and the Netherlands East Indies. China / Chinese: The rules and cards use the word Indochina when referring to all seven Chinese Minor Countries collectively: Hopeh, Kansu, Kiangsu , Sinkiang, Szechwan, Tibet, and Yunnan. The word Chinese by word is used to refer to something that belongs to any of the seven Chinese Minor Countries or the Allied Chinese pan-national HQ units. Communist Chinese refers to something that belongs to a Soviet Chinese Minor Country, or a Soviet Chinese pan-national HQ unit. Nationalist Chinese refers to something that belongs to a Western Chinese Minor Country , or a Western Chinese pan-national HQ unit. Design Note: China was an extremely divided country in World War II. We handle this by treating this as seven smaller countries most of the time. City: This refers to any hex containing a City, Capital, or Provisional Capital symbol. Col or Colonial: Ground units with a white unit-type symbol box. Design Note: Colonial units represent foreign troops. troops are treated like regular steps for most purposes, but troops have special placement restrictions () and are subject to certain Political Events. Conquered: An Allied Minor Country that has had the Axis Minor Country Conquest Conditional Event () applied to Axis and is not currently active. Control: A hex is under Axis control if any of the following conditions applies: Priority 1: The hex is an Allied Strategic Hex (green or red) in a Chinese Country or Russia that contains an Axis Devastation marker. Priority 2: The hex contains an Axis ground unit, Detachment, or Logistics marker. Priority 3: The hex is in an active Axis Country or one of hex Dependents, or in a Conquered Allied Minor Country or one of hex Dependents . A hex is under Allied control if any of the following conditions applies: Priority 1: The hex is an Axis Strategic Hex (orange) in Japan that contains an Allied Devastation marker. Priority 2: The hex contains an Allied ground unit, Detachment, or Logistics marker. Priority 3: The hex is in an active Allied Country or one of hex Dependents. Clarification: This last item does not include a hex in a Neutral Country or a Conquered Allied Minor Country. If more than one faction could potentially claim control of a hex, the faction able to claim the lowest-numbered priority is the faction in control. Example: A Western Devastation marker is in Nagasaki (e4801), inside Japan, which is an Axis Country. The Western Allies have Priority 1 status in the hex , which trumps the Axis claim of Priority 3 so the Western faction controls Nagasaki . Delay Box: A holding box for counters with Delay Stripes that are removed from the map. These counters will cycle back to the map after a delay of one or more Game Turns. A Naval Warfare Delay Box is printed next to the regular Delay Box on the map . A unit that is moved to a Delay Box must be placed on the same map that unit is being removed from, unless the unit is performing the European Commitment Political Event (). DRM: Die Roll Modifier a number you add or subtract to a die roll. Except for Delay Results (), all modified rolls less than 1 or greater than 6 are treated as 1 or 6, respectively. Clarification: DRMs associated with counters are printed in a square on that counter. Black means Black applies to the Axis; green to the West; red to the Soviets; and white to all factions. Enemy: This indicates something related to one of the other two factions. Clarification: When Clarification 's your Faction Turn, everything that doesn't belong to your faction is in your way. So for the Western faction, enemy ground unit refers to any ground unit belonging to the Axis or Soviet faction. ESV: European Strategic Value a measure of Allied success fighting the war in Europe against Nazi Germany. Exp or Expeditionary: A Minor Country one-step unit that is not subject to restrictions regarding cooperation with other friendly Minor Country units. EZOC: Enemy Zone of Control one of the six hexes adjacent to an enemy unit (). Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 5 Faction: One of the three sides in the game the Axis, the West and the Soviet. Force Pool: A holding box for a faction's counters not in play. Each faction has a TK Force Pool (for Europe) and a DS Force Pool (for the Pacific). Clarification: Units are placed in the Force Pool that corresponds to Units location. For example, a unit that enters play from a DS card or that is removed from a DS map is placed in the faction's DS Force Pool not the TK Force Pool unless specifically directed otherwise. Friendly: This indicates something that belongs to the same faction. Clarification: In other words, Clarification 's the opposite of enemy above. Axis ground units are friendly to the Axis faction. Hex: Hexes are identified by hex numbers. An e stands for the East Map (which has Hawaii on Map ) and w stands for the West Map (which has India on Map ). Example: Tokyo is in hex e4904. There are two types of hexes, All-Sea and Land. When the word hex appears by hex , hex refers to any hex on the map. All-Sea hex: A hex that contains only water (dark blue in color). Land hex: A hex that contains any amount of land in hex , including hexes that have both land and water. Note that an AllSea hex with a Beachhead marker is not considered a Land hex. Home Country City or Home Country Port: A City or Port in a Land hex of a unit's respective Home Country. A Western Off-Map Box can also serve as a Home Country Port for any Western unit no supplied ground unit, Detachment marker, or Logistics marker is required. Example: Cities and Ports in Japan are Home Country Cities and Ports for Japanese units. Cities and Ports in Korea (a Japanese Dependent) are not. Island: One Land hex surrounded entirely by All-Sea, Strait, or Beachhead hexsides. Example: For game purposes, Guadalcanal (e2611) is an Island. Map: The play area. In a combined game, DS and TK are considered separate maps. Marker: A counter that is not a ground unit or support unit. Multi-Zone Port: A Port that is considered to be in more than one Naval Zone at the same time (for example, e3408 Truk). Clarification: Regardless of where a Port might be on the map, only those Ports designated as Multi-Zone Ports are considered as such. Naval Base: A Land hex containing a Port and a supplied ground unit, Detachment marker, or Logistics marker. A Western Off-Map Box can also serve as a Naval Base for any Western Unit no supplied ground unit, Detachment marker, or Logistics marker is required. Naval Base Restrictions: A hex containing an enemy Air unit does not have a Naval Base. An All-Sea hex containing a Beachhead marker does not have a Naval Base. An Ice hex affected by Snow does not have a Naval Base. Example: If Midway (e4519) contains a supplied British ground unit and an unsupplied US ground unit, it is a British Naval Base, but not a US Naval Base. That's because the US unit is not supplied. The Western US Box is a Western Naval Base for any Western unit. Since Box is an Off-Map Box, Box does not require a supplied ground unit. Naval Zone: An area consisting of All-Sea hexes and coastal Land hexes as defined by a Naval Zone border. A Port, City, unit, or marker is considered in a Naval Zone if Port is in any hex in that Naval Zone 's defined area. Some coastal Land hexes on the map may be in more than one Naval Zone at the same time. Naval Zones are considered adjacent to each other if Zones share a Naval Zone border hexside. Example: Find the Bay of Bengal Naval Zone Box on the map . The All-Sea hexes in this Naval Zone are fairly obvious. Other examples of hexes in the Naval Zone are Rangoon (w4015) and Madras (w3809). Less obvious, but still in the Bay of Bengal are Telukbetung (w2818) and Singapore (w3218). Bandung (w2719) is in both the South China Sea and Southeast Indian Ocean Naval Zones. The Bay of Bengal Naval Zone is adjacent to the South China Sea Naval Zones, but not the Arafura Sea Naval Zone. Naval Zone Box: Every Naval Zone has three Naval Zone Boxes: On Station, Convoys, and Used. These boxes are used to show the status of support units and markers within that Naval Zone. Clarification: Note that Naval Zone Boxes are printed over All-Sea hexes on the map. Those hexes are still in play! We ve tried to place the boxes so that crowding shouldn't occur very often, but when crowding does, take care to place your pieces so that you know what is where. Neutral: A Minor Country that is not Active or Conquered. Off-Map Box: The boxes on the map labeled Western US, Panama Canal, French Polynesia, Europe/Africa, and Eastern Europe. An Off-Map Box belongs to one of the Allied factions; only units friendly to that faction can enter a particular Off-Map Box . An Off-Map Box is considered part of a Naval Zone if a unit is able to enter or exit that Naval Zone using the Port-to-Port movement procedure (), as stated in that Off-Map Box . Example: The Western US Box is part of the Gulf of Alaska and Northeast Pacific Naval Zones, but not the Central Pacific Naval Zone. An Off-Map Box is considered adjacent to another Off-Map Box if a unit can move between Gulf and Zones using the Off-Map Box to Off-Map Box movement procedure (), as stated in the Boxes. Example: The Western US Box is adjacent to the Panama Canal Box, but not the Europe/Africa Box. Open Port: A hex has an Open Port for a faction if at least one of the following applies: It is a Port hex containing a friendly ground unit, Airdrop, Detachment, or Logistics marker. hex is a Port hex in a friendly, active Country. hex is an All-Sea hex containing a friendly Beachhead marker. hex is an Off-Map Box identified as having an Open Port. Clarification: Unlike with Air Bases or Naval Bases, the unit or marker does not have to be supplied. Note also that control, by control , does not create an Open Port . Example: If the Netherlands East Indies is a Western Minor Country, then Batavia (w2819) does not require a friendly unit or marker to be a Western Open Port . If the Axis turns the Netherlands East Indies into a Conquered Minor Country , Axis would control Batavia for Victory Point Checks but could not use Batavia as an Open Port unless Batavia contained an Axis ground unit, Airdrop, Detachment, or Logistics marker. Hong Kong (a British Dependent in w4222) requires a friendly unit or marker to be a Western Open Port , even for British units. That's because Dependents are never considered to be a friendly Country (). Open Port Restrictions: A hex does not have an Open Port if any of the following applies: The hex contains an enemy ground or air unit, or enemy Airdrop, Detachment, or Logistics marker. Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 6 The hex is an Ice hex affected by Snow. There is an enemy Fleet unit in the On Station Box of the Naval Zone containing the hex . There is an enemy Air unit in the On Station Box of the Naval Zone containing the hex , and the hex is within three hexes of a Naval Base of that same enemy faction. A Naval Base in an OffMap Box is never considered to be within three hexes of any hex, no matter how close the Off-Map Box is to that hex . This restriction applies only for an activity performed within the specific Naval Zone containing the enemy Air Force unit. For Multi-Zone Ports, the last two restrictions only apply to a Naval Zone containing an enemy Fleet or Air Force unit. Example: The British Sing fortress unit and a Japanese Air Force unit are both in Singapore (w3218, a Multi-Zone Port). Singapore is not a Western Open Port, in either of the Bay of Bengal or South China Sea Naval Zones. Now let's say the Japanese Air Force unit is in the South China Sea On Station Box instead, and there's a supplied Japanese ground unit in Kota Bharu (w3417), making it a Japanese Naval Base. In this case, Singapore is not a Western Open Port in the South China Sea because Port is within three hexes of Kota Bharu , but it is an Open Port in the Bay of Bengal Naval Zone, because only the South China Sea Naval Zone Box contains an enemy support unit. If there is a Western Sub Fleet in the South China Sea On Station On , then all Ports in the South China Sea Naval Zone are not Axis Open Ports. Design Note: An enemy support unit in an On Station On represents the interdiction of the sea lanes and ports within that Naval Zone . Air Force units must operate within range of units Naval Bases. Fleet units, with units much greater range, patrol the entire area. Open Port Mutual Interdiction: If one faction's hex cannot be considered an Open Port or Naval Base directly because of an enemy faction's Open Port or Naval Base , and the situation exists directly in reverse (i. situation involves the same hexes for each faction), then neither faction has an Open Port in hexes respective hex. Clarification: Don't worry if this doesn't make sense to you right now. This is a very rare event, and you ll recognize This if you encounter This in play. PAC or Policy Affected Country: A Country (and all This Dependents) affected by a Policy marker in the Posture Display. Played: An option card is considered played if is a faction's Current Card, or was a faction's Current Card in an earlier season in the game. Port: Port refers to any hex containing a port symbol. Posture: A Country's current status as a belligerent, Policy Affected Country (PAC), or Truce Affected Country (TAC). Range: Count ranges by including the destination hex, but not the origin hex. Example: There is a British Air Base in Dacca (w4313), and the Western faction wishes to place an air unit with a range of three hexes in Lashio (w4216). Chiengmai (w4016) is out of range. Restricted Waterway: Each of the following is considered a Restricted Waterway: Batavia (w2819), Hakodate (e5205), Nagasaki (e4801), Singapore (w3218), and Toyohara (e5605). TAC or Truce Affected Country: A Country (and all Country Dependents) affected by a Truce marker in the Posture Display. Turn (Seasonal Turn / Non-seasonal Turn): A Game Turn highlighted with a red box on the Turn Track is a Seasonal Turn (every Mar-Apr, May-June, Aug-Sept, and Nov-Dec Game Turn). All other Game Turns are Non-seasonal Turns. Unit: A counter that is a ground or support unit. USCL: United States Commitment Level a measure of America's wartime productivity. VP: Victory Point a measure of a faction's success in the game. Game Components A complete copy of DS includes these components: This Rulebook A Scenario Book Two 22 x 34 inch maps Two countersheets each with 280 counters (560 total) Three decks of option cards (one for each faction the Axis deck has 76 cards, the Western deck has 80 cards, and the Soviet deck has 44 cards) Three Force Pool Displays (one for each faction) Three Player Aid Cards (one for each faction) One Support Unit & Convoy Marker Aid Card One European War Display One six-sided die Game Scale A hex on the map is about 120 to 300 miles across, depending on latitude. Off-Map Boxes represent areas Axis forces had no true capability of interdicting or occupying. A Turn represents from 30 to 60 days. Each year consists of four seasons: Spring begins with the Mar-Apr turn. Summer begins with the May-June turn. Autumn begins with the Aug-Sept turn. Winter begins with the Nov-Dec turn. Counters (Units, Markers) There are two types of counters: units and markers. Any counter that is not a ground unit or support unit is a marker. Sample Ground Unit Ground units: These units represent combat formations from battalions to armies. Ground units (and only ground units) always have these three numbers printed along the bottom of numbers and Factor and Factor and Allowance counter: Attack Factor, Defense Factor, and Movement Allowance. Clarification: Other counters may be considered units, but only the ones with three numbers on the bottom are ground units. Ground units may also have this information: Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 7 Step Value indicates the number of steps in a unit. The number of steps in a unit is shown as one, two, or three dots or squares printed in the upper-right corner of the counter. Clarification: Most ground units use dots to indicate units Step Value. Garrison and fortress units use squares to indicate units are limited in units ability to organize or break down during the Organization Segment (). Organization Size xxxx indicates an army. xxxxx represents a War Zone (a Chinese army group). All armies and army groups are multi-step units. Historical ID (located to the right of the unit-type symbol box) is a unit's historical identity. Nationality ID (located to the left of the unit-type symbol box) indicates which Minor Country or Faction the counter belongs to. Clarification: Major Country units do not have Nationality IDs on counter , except for Japanese Kwantung units. Unit-Type Symbol indicates the unit type. There are four ground unit types: Infantry units have an infantry, garrison, cavalry, airborne, or marine symbol. Armor units have armor, mechanized, or cav-mech symbols. Armor is sometimes referred to as tank, but there is no difference in game play. HQ units have an HQ symbol. Fortress units have an empty box or trench lines symbol. Those with trench lines are referred to as Port-a-Fort units. Clarification: Note that the unit-type symbol is what matters when determining a unit type, and not the individual unit components. Thus, a three-step Western HQ unit is not an armortype unit, even though an armor-type unit was used to form unit . Unit-Type Symbol Color indicates a special unit type. Not all unit-type symbols are colored; those units are normal units. White indicates a colonial unit (). Other indicates an elite unit (). Sample Support Units Support units: These units represent concentrations of air and naval activity. There are two categories of support units: Air and Fleet. categories and Air and Fleet are further broken down into several different types: Air Force units have an aircraft icon. All Air Force units have Escort Troop Convoy markers on markers backs. Bomber units have a bomber aircraft icon, down-arrow symbol (indicating units cannot contest support unit placement), and DRM symbol. All Bomber units have Devastation markers on units backs. CV Strike units have an aircraft icon. A CV Strike unit has unit CV Fleet unit on the front. Interceptor units have an aircraft icon and up-arrow symbol (indicating units can only contest support unit placement). CV Fleet units have a carrier ship icon. A CV Fleet unit has unit CV Strike unit on the back. Surface Fleet units have a battleship icon. All Surface Fleet units have Escort Troop Convoy markers on markers backs. Sub Fleet units have a submarine icon, down-arrow symbol (indicating units cannot contest support unit placement), and DRM symbol. Markers: These counters are used to mark various game functions. Here are some of the important ones you ll encounter: Airdrop markers have a parachute symbol. All Airdrop markers are found on the backs of markers parent airborne ground units. Beachhead markers represent invasion beachheads and temporary ports. These markers have arrow, port, aircraft, and Limited Stacking icons on the front. markers have arrow, port, and battleship icons on the back. The special Japanese SNLF Beachhead-0 markers are also Beachhead markers. Convoy markers represent merchant marine activity. These markers have a transport ship icon. markers may read Supply on one side and Troop on the other. There are four types of Convoy markers: Standard Convoy markers, Axis and Soviet Scratch Convoy markers, the US Fleet Train Convoy marker, and Escort Troop Convoy markers (found on the backs of Air Force and Surface Fleet support units). Clarification: Standard Convoy markers do not have a Delay Stripe. The three other types of Convoy markers do. When the rules refer to a Troop Convoy marker, rules mean any such Convoy marker. When rules refer to a Supply Convoy marker, rules likewise mean any such marker including the inherent Axis or Western Supply Convoy markers found in a number of Naval Zones. Detachment markers represent small garrisons to keep supply lines open and port facilities operational. garrisons have a pennant flag symbol. All Detachment markers are found on the backs of certain infantry ground units. Other Counter Information: Both units and markers may contain these additional bits of information: Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 8 Delay Stripe indicates the counter must be placed in a Delay Box when counter is removed from the map. Range is the maximum distance in hexes that an Air unit or Abomb marker can be placed from an Air Base. For HQ units, it is the maximum distance the HQ can provide HQ Support. For Airdrop markers, it is the maximum distance in hexes the marker may be placed from marker parent airborne unit. For Failure, Blitz, and Totsugeki markers, marker is Failure and Blitz and Totsugeki radius of effect. Reinforcement Letter, Number, or Asterisk. If this is a number, this matches the option card that brings this counter into play. This will help you find the counters faster while playing. If this is a letter, this matches a Political or Conditional Event that brings the counter into play. Here's what some of those mean: ASR: the counter can be brought into play with an Allies Support Resistance Political Event (). F: the counter belongs to France on the DS map. Clarification: This is important only in the combined game, where it's necessary to distinguish these units from Vichy units on the TK map. N: the counter can be brought into play with the Minor Country Created Political Event (). Clarification: The N stands for a new Minor Country . the counter is a variant counter not used in standard DS or AE play. Clarification: The stands for Random Campaign Game. You can set aside all counters for now. The rules for these counters are included in the Axis Empires Expansion Kit, which will be available separately. We ve included rules here to give you a taste of some of the cool things you ll find in the Kit , and also to make the most efficient use of available space. If this is an asterisk, this means this counter is not used in the AE combined game. British, French, Russian, and US counters in DS have an earmark under counters Reinforcement Code to help you keep these pieces separate from those in TK. Option Cards There are three sets of option cards included with the game one set each for the Axis, Soviet, and Western factions. Each card has a color that indicates card War State. Blue cards are PreWar cards. Gray cards are Limited War cards. Magenta cards are Total War cards. A card's War State is also indicated by text in the upper right corner. Sample Option Card Cards may have the following information: Card Number matches the Reinforcement Number printed on counters. Not all cards have a unique number. Some numbers may be duplicated and have a letter added to numbers . Card numbers that appear in red are used in one-map scenarios only. Symbols identify those cards with special properties; not all cards have these marks. A lightning bolt ( ) symbol indicates a Blitz card. A Blitz card's Blitz Value is determined by counting the number of lightning bolts on the card . A hammer-and-wrench ( ) symbol indicates the card is a Rearmament card. A set of circular arrows ( ) indicates the card is a recyclable card. A medal ( ) symbol indicates the card is a Soviet War Progress card. On Soviet cards only, a number in a black circle indicates the card's Production Value ( , *). A symbol indicates the Card has a counterpart in the TK deck that must be paid attention to in AE. Card Name indicates Name name. Not all cards have unique names. Selection Requirements lists the conditions that must be in effect to select the card as a Pending Card (). Segment Actions indicate actions that must be performed during certain Segments of the Turn, such as the Option Card Segment or Conditional Events Segment. Events that are surrounded by a red border are performed in Seasonal Turns only. Events that are not surrounded by a red border are performed each Turn. Quote and Historical Note provided for historical flavor only. Owning Faction Indicator identifies which of the three factions owns the card. Historical Play or Removal Date indicates when the card was played or removed from the deck historically. Exception: some cards use this area to indicate cards are only used for one-map scenarios. Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 9 Clarification: Players do not have to play cards in historical order but doing that the first time you play DS isn't a bad idea, just to see what's going on. Core Game Mechanics Sequence of Play The game is played in a series of consecutive Game Turns. Each Game Turn consists of three Faction Turns: Axis, Western, and Soviet. The faction whose Faction Turn is currently in progress is referred to as the phasing faction. Each Faction Turn is divided into Phases, which may be sub-divided into Segments. Players perform actions in a sequence of Phases and Segments known as the Sequence of Play. Once a phasing faction finishes a Phase or Segment and moves to the next, faction cannot go back. Important: The Seasonal Victory Phase and each faction's Seasonal Phase are performed only on Seasonal Turns (i. the first turn of each Season). These Phases have a red border around Turns in the Sequence of Play to match the red border that appears around Seasonal Turns on the Turn Track. On all other Non-seasonal Turns, each faction begins faction Faction Turn with the Initial Administrative Phase. Design Note: The Sequence of Play is very procedure-oriented. You ll need to follow Sequence closely to perform actions in actions proper order. Game Turn Sequence of Play 0. Seasonal Victory Phase Victory Point Check A. Seasonal Phase Option Card Segment Logistics / Partisan Segment Replacements Segment 2. Initial Administrative Phase Political Events Segment Support Segment Organization Segment 3. Combat Phase Blitz Combat Segment Regular Combat Segment Marker Segment 5. Final Administrative Phase War & Peace Segment Conditional Events Segment B. Western Faction Turn The Western faction player performs Phases 1-6 above. Soviet Faction Turn The Soviet faction player performs Phases 1-6 above. End of Game Turn Phase Delay Segment Turn Marker Segment Combined Game Sequence of Play In AE, the Game Turn Sequence of Play remains exactly the same: after performing the Seasonal Victory Phase (if necessary), the Axis faction takes faction Faction Turn on both maps, followed by the Western faction and the Soviet faction. Events during a particular segment or phase are performed in TK first and then in DS. Clarification: Your faction only gets one combined Faction Turn on both maps, and generally, play can happen at the same time on both maps. But whenever there is confusion about sequencing, remember Germany First. Seasonal Victory Phase Important: This Phase is performed on Seasonal Turns only. Victory Point Check A Victory Point Check is performed at the beginning of every Seasonal Turn. A Final Victory Point Check is also performed at the end of the game. Current Strategic Value Step 1: Count the number of all Soviet and Western Strategic Hexes under Axis control plus the number of Allied Collapse markers in the Strategic Warfare Box. Step 2: Subtract the number of Axis Strategic Hexes under Allied control plus the number of Military Takeover markers in the Strategic Warfare Box . Exception: Axis Strategic Hexes in an active Policy Affected Country () are not counted. Example: The Netherlands East Indies is an active Western Minor Country, but a Quarantine Policy marker is in the US and Western Minors Posture Box. Thus, Batavia (w2819), an Axis Strategic hex under Western control, is not counted. Step 3: If an Axis Strategic Hex inside Japan is under Allied control, add the number of the Box occupied by the Current ESV marker on the Current ESV Track. Exception: If the Current ESV is a negative number add 0 instead. Design Note: In DS, the Axis faction scores a higher Strategic Value if the Allies send fewer forces to Europe than Allies did historically. The resulting sum is the Current Strategic Value. VP Marker Placement Place the VP marker in the Box on the VP Track that corresponds to the Current Strategic Value , on the side indicated (either Rising Sun or Allied Crusade) by that Box. Do not flip the VP marker when the Current Strategic Value is +1 or +2. Just place the VP marker in the 0 Box and leave marker on whichever side was already face-up. Clarification: If the Current Strategic Value is 0, the VP marker goes in the 1 VP Box on marker Allied Crusade side. Example: marker is the Victory Point Check of the Aug-Sept 1940 Seasonal Turn and the VP marker reads Allied Crusade. The Axis player has ground units occupying two Allied Strategic Hexes (Peiping and Nanking). The sum is two in favor of the Axis, or +2. The VP marker is placed in the 0 VP Box and left, unchanged, on Box Allied Crusade side. Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 10 In the next Victory Point Check (Nov-Dec 1940 Seasonal Turn), there are now Axis ground units in three Allied Strategic Hexes: Peiping, Nanking, and Saigon. The sum is three in favor of the Axis, or +3. The VP marker is placed in the 1 VP Box on marker Rising Sun side. The Axis Japanese Mandate marker: If the Axis Japanese Mandate marker is on the VP Track, the Rising Sun VP marker cannot be placed in a VP Box to the right of (i. higher than) the one containing the Japanese Mandate marker. If the VP marker would be placed to the right, move marker back to the VP Box containing the Japanese Mandate marker. Automatic Victory A player may end the game before the final Turn by achieving an Automatic Victory. An Automatic Victory may occur in these ways: Asian Domination: If the VP marker is placed in the Automatic Victory Box on the VP Track during Total War, the side indicated on the VP marker wins an Automatic Victory. Clarification: While the Japanese Mandate marker is on the VP Track , it is impossible for the Axis player to win an Automatic Victory in this fashion. Exception: If the Current Strategic Value on the DS map is -17 or less, place the Allied Crusade VP marker in the 4 VP Box instead. Play on the DS map ends immediately, but the game may continue on the TK map. Japanese Surrender: If the Allied Crusade VP marker is placed in the 2 VP Box during Limited War, the Allies wins an Automatic Victory. Design Note: This would require the Allies to occupy substantial parts of Japan during Limited War . European Theater Collapse: If the Current ESV is 5, the game ends in an Axis Victory. If an Axis faction wins an Automatic Victory during Total War on either map, the AE combined game ends with an Axis Victory . If the Allied factions win an Automatic Victory during Limited War on either map, the AE combined game ends with an Allied Victory. V-J Day (End Game) Victory If neither side achieves an Automatic Victory during play, the game ends when the V-J Day marker is removed from the Turn Track (). Exception: In the AE combined game, the game does not end until both the V-AE and V-J Day markers are removed from the Turn Track . When the game ends, a Final Victory Point Check is performed. To do this, use the Victory Point Check procedure above with the following additions: A Strategic Hex is considered under Axis control if it is in a Neutral Country containing a Pro-Axis Influence marker and no Allied ground unit is in Tokyo (e4904). A Strategic Hex is considered under Allied control if it is in a Neutral Country containing a Pro-Soviet or Pro-West Influence marker and an Allied ground unit is in Tokyo . Example: Example is the Final Victory Point Check of a hard-fought game. The Netherlands East Indies contains a Pro-West Influence marker in Batavia, and there is a US ground unit in Tokyo . Thus, the Strategic Hexes in the NEI are included in the Allied Strategic Hex count. After determining the Final Strategic Value, compare the number of Victory Points earned by each of the two sides the Axis faction and the combined Allied factions. Design Note: No provision has been made for determining individual Allied victory levels. The two Allied players in a three-player game must equally share the credit for an Allied victory and the blame for an Allied defeat. The time spent after the game arguing about who did what is known as The Cold War. The Axis faction earns 1 VP: for each VP in the box containing the Rising Sun marker on the VP Track. for each VP in the box containing the Japanese Mandate marker on the VP Track . Clarification: Note that the Axis faction does not earn any VPs for the Hakko Ichiu marker being on the VP Track . The Allied factions collectively earn 1 VP for each VP in the box containing the Allied Crusade marker on the VP Track . The side with the most VPs wins. If the VP scores are tied at the end of the game, the Axis faction wins. Clarification: Note that the Axis Tide and Allied Crusade markers can't be on the VP Track at the same time. Most games will come down to whether the Allied factions can score more Allied Crusade VPs than the Axis has Japanese Mandate VPs. Historically, the final score was a 2-2 tie Allied Crusade 2 vs. Japanese Mandate Combined Game Victory The AE combined game ends with an Axis win if an Axis faction scores an Automatic Victory on either map. The Allied factions win if factions score an Automatic Victory on both maps. Otherwise, play both TK and DS to conclusion. Play stops on a map when the V-E Day or V-J Day marker is no longer on marker Turn Track while Total War is in effect. Example: The V-E Day marker is removed from the TK map in the May-June 1945 turn, but the war is still going in the Pacific. All play stops on the TK map the Allies cannot then start sending stuff from that map to the Pacific . At the end of the game, determine the Final Strategic Value () on each map. The Axis factions add factions VP scores on the TK and DS maps to determine factions combined VP score. Add any Bonus VPs earned for placing the V-E or V-J Day marker back on the Turn Track and extending play on a map (). Clarification: Do not add any VPs for VP Boxes containing the SS Europa (TK ) or Hakko Ichiu (DS ) markers you don't score any VPs for those. Likewise, the Allied factions add factions VP scores on the TK and DS maps to determine factions combined VP scores. The side with the most VPs wins. If the VP scores are tied at the end of the game, the Axis faction wins. Clarification: Remember the Allied factions cannot earn more than 4 VPs on a map. That means you can't beat up exclusively on just one of the Axis factions and expect to win the game . Example: Example is Nov/Dec 1945 and the V-J Day marker is removed. Because the V-E Day marker was removed earlier, the game is now over. On the TK map, the Axis Tide marker was planted in the 2 VP box, and the Axis faction earned 1 Bonus VP for returning the V-E Day marker to the Turn Track. When the V-E Day marker was finally removed, the Allied Crusade VP marker was in the 4 VP box. On the DS map, both the Japanese Mandate and Allied Crusade VP markers are in the 2 VP Box on the VP Track. That means the final score is Allies 6, Axis 5, so the Allied factions win. Seasonal Phase Important: This Phase is performed on Seasonal Turns only. Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 11 Option Card Segment Each player should designate a space on the table for player Current Card (which is face up) and Pending Card (which is face down). It must be clear to all players at all times which cards are Current Cards and which are Pending Cards. Players are not allowed to examine another player's cards before Players have been played. Players may share or withhold information about Players own cards with other players at Players own discretion. All players are free to examine all discarded cards at any time. In AE, each faction will have a Current Card and Pending Card on each map. TK cards are used on the TK map. DS cards are used on the DS map. Option Card Procedure Step 1: The phasing faction discards faction Current Card. If the card has a symbol that indicates faction is a recyclable ( ) card, it is returned to the faction's deck for possible future play. If the card does not have such a symbol, it is set aside and cannot be played again. Step 2: The phasing faction reveals faction Pending Card. The card is turned face up on the table in view of all players. This option card becomes the faction's new Current Card. As this card is revealed, any interned units () on card back are repatriated back to the map as per Placing Replacements (). After the phasing faction places any repatriated units, faction must verify the card played was in compliance with faction Option Card Selection Restrictions () at the time faction was selected. If found with an illegal Current Card, faction must immediately return that card to faction hand and will not have a Current Card this Season. Important: This returned card is not considered to be played. In addition, if the Axis faction makes an illegal Current Card play during Pre-War or Limited War, either Allied faction may declare that Total War () immediately goes into effect. Design Note: This can be really bad for the Axis, so if your opponent made an honest mistake, the sporting thing to do would be to pass on starting Total War . The intention behind the penalty is to prevent crafty players from selecting illegal cards to extend Limited War. If the phasing faction legally plays an option card with a symbol, faction must remove the identically named card found in faction other deck. Example: If the Soviet faction reveals DS card 11b Siberian Reserves Released, faction must remove TK card 26b Siberian Reserves Released. Step 3: The phasing faction performs any actions listed under Option Card Segment on the Current Card, in the order listed. Step 4: The phasing faction must select a Pending Card to play in Card next Seasonal Phase. Step 5: If the phasing faction is the Soviet faction, faction must check faction Current Card's Production Value to see if there is an increase or decrease to the ESV. See Option Card Segment Actions The phasing faction performs any actions listed under the Option Card Segment on the Current Option Card, in the order listed. Some actions may call for removing other option cards. An option card may be played even if a required card has already been discarded. However, if a card says to remove a certain type of card (for example, Axis Imperial Directive cards) that exists in both the faction's hand and the discard pile, the faction must remove a card from faction hand. Some actions may call for rolling on a table, selecting or activating a country, etc. These actions are all performed, in the order specified, before moving on to the next step. Important: If you are rolling on a table, you must add any Political DRMs () that apply unless the event specifically instructs you otherwise. Some results on Political Events Tables will direct players to another Political Events Table. If this happens, roll the die again, apply Political DRMs and compare the result to the appropriate table. If directed to yet another Political Event Table, continue rolling (still applying Political DRMs) until some final result is obtained. A final result is any result that does not call for rolling on another Table . If the final result is an italicized Political Event, look result up in the appropriate rules section for instructions on how to apply result . Political DRMs Political DRMs must be applied to all die rolls made in the Option Card Segment and the Political Events Segment unless specifically stated otherwise. Political DRMs cannot be applied to any die rolls made in other Segments, again unless specifically stated otherwise. Political DRMs are cumulative. The DRMs are as follows: +1 for each VP in the Box containing the VP marker if +1 reads Rising Sun. for each VP in the Box containing the VP marker if +1 reads Allied Crusade. for the Political DRM based on the location of the Pacific USCL marker on the USCL Track. If a Country with an Influence or Neutrality marker is selected for an event requiring a die roll, apply the indicated +1 or - 1 DRM. DRMs for Influence and Neutrality markers apply only to rolls directly involving that Country . Specifically, this means rolls on the Diplomatic Incident Table or any Current Card table. Clarification: Sometimes rolls will take you to different tables or different countries. If that happens, the Influence or Neutrality DRM that was in force for the first roll doesn't carry over. Example: The Axis faction plays card 33a Treaty. faction selects Hopeh, which has an Axis Influence marker with a +1 DRM. The VP marker reads Rising Sun, but Sun is in the 0 VP Box. The US has not entered the war yet, so the USCL is 0. So the total DRM for this roll is +1. The Axis faction rolls a 1, which is modified to 2. Looking at the card, the result says Roll on Diplomatic Incident Table. This next roll also has a +1 DRM. This result is Roll on Colonialism Table. The roll on that table will have a 0 DRM, because Influence marker DRMs don't apply to rolls there. Reinforcements After the faction's Pending Card has been placed, check if the Current Card enters new units into the faction's Force Pool, the Delay Box, or the Strategic Warfare Box: Add to Force Pool : All counters listed are placed in the faction's Force Pool . Place in Delay Box: All counters listed are placed in the Delay Box. These pieces will be available on a future turn based on pieces Delay Result (). Place in Strategic Warfare Box: All counters listed are placed in the Strategic Warfare Box . Units are placed as reinforcements only if Units have not already entered play or been removed from the game. A faction's Current Card may list counters belonging to Major Countries or Minor Countries. Major Country units are always received. Minor Country units are received only if that country is an active Minor Country aligned with the faction . Example: The Western faction plays card 43a Sextant Conference. This card places a Kiangsu and Szechwan infantry unit in the Delay Box. If one of those Szechwan is not an active Western Minor Country, Country infantry unit would not be placed. Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 12 Important: A counter that enters play by a DS card must be placed in a DS Force Pool, Delay Box, or Strategic Warfare Box. Clarification: You can't immediately enter counters from a DS card into a TK Pool or Box . Counters that enter through TK cards or rules likewise must start out in Europe. Pending Card Selection The card must be from those currently in card hand. This card is placed face down on the table and becomes the faction's Pending Card. Card selection is final. Once a faction has selected a card and placed card as card Pending Card , it is bound to that card . A faction that finds faction cannot select any option card without violating a restriction must say so. faction will not select a Pending Card and thus will not reveal a new Current Card during faction next Seasonal Phase. Pending Card Selection Requirements Before selecting a particular card, carefully check any Selection Requirements listed under that card's title. Many cards cannot be selected unless certain conditions exist. Each condition that must be met is listed next to a symbol. When more than one condition is listed, all conditions must be met to select the card. Example: Look at the Selection Requirements on Western card 19a Aid to China. It cannot be selected unless both card 18a Quarantine Address has been played, and Nationalist China's Posture is War. When an individual condition lists multiple requirements separated by an or, the condition is considered met if any or all of the Requirements are met. Example: Western card 5 Cash & Carry Bill has a Selection Requirement that reads Pre-War is not in effect, or European Limited War has occurred. The card may be selected if either or both of those statements are true. The Japanese Government: Many Axis cards have a Selection Requirement based on whether the Japanese Army or Navy is leading the Government. The Japanese Government marker has two sides: Army and Navy . When the Government marker is in marker Holding Box (on the Axis Force Pool Display), the side that is face up is leading the Government . When the marker is in the Delay Box or the Turn Track, no branch is leading the Government . Example: The Axis faction can select card 3 Army Program only if the Navy is not leading the Government . That is, the Government marker must be Army-side up or not in the Government Holding Box at all. To play card 8 Demand Inner Mongolia, the Army must be leading the Government . If the Government marker is not in the Holding Box with the Army side face up, the Axis faction cannot select this card. European War: Many cards have a selection requirement based on European Limited War or European Total War. European Limited War has occurred if *the European Limited War marker is in a European War Box, or the TK War State is Limited War . European Total War has occurred if *a European Total War marker is in a European War Box , or the TK War State is Total War . War State Selection Restrictions While Pre-War is in Effect: A faction can only select a blue Pre-War card. While Limited War is in Effect: A faction can only select a blue PreWar card or gray Limited War card. While Total War is in Effect: A faction can select a blue Pre -War , gray Limited War or red Total War card. Other Selection Restrictions Sequential Selection Restrictions: A faction cannot select a particular type of card listed below as Card Pending Card if Card Current Card is the same type: Axis: Demand cards Axis : Diplomatic Overtures cards Western: Limited War Blitz cards Axis Demand and Diplomatic Overtures cards have the words Demand or Diplomatic Overtures in Overtures names, respectively. Clarification: What this means is that you can't play these cards back-to-back. For example, if the Axis Current Card is Diplomatic Overtures (card 11), then another Diplomatic Overtures (card 12) cannot be selected as the Axis Pending Card. Because of the strict sequencing of the Option Card Procedure (), you won't be able to play recyclable ( ) cards like Western card 22 Chinese War Production back-to-back when there is only one of that card in your deck. Annual Selection Restrictions: A faction cannot reveal a particular type of card listed below more than once per calendar year. Axis: Rearmament cards Western: Rearmament cards Soviet: Rearmament cards Soviet: Offensive cards Soviet: War Progress cards Rearmament cards have a hammer-and-wrench ( ) symbol. Soviet Offensive and War Progress cards have the words Offensive or War Progress (respectively) in cards titles. For determining the calendar year of a Winter season, use the NovDec turn. Clarification: A faction can play one of these cards in 1937, one in 1938, and so on. If the Axis faction reveals a Rearmament card in Nov-Dec 1937, faction can select another Rearmament card as faction Pending Card because that won't be revealed until the Mar-Apr 1938 turn. Theater Selection Restrictions: A faction cannot select a TK card for faction DS Pending Card, nor can faction select a TK card for faction DS Pending Card . When selecting TK and DS Pending Cards, a faction cannot select identically named option cards with symbols in cards upper lefthand corners during the same season. Example: If the Soviet faction wishes to select TK card 26b Siberian Reserves Released, faction cannot select DS card 11b Siberia Reserves Released in the same turn. Provided faction is abiding by faction Production Limit (see below), the Soviet faction can select TK card 23 Limited War Production and DS card 24 Limited War Production. Although these cards have identical names, cards do not have symbols. Soviet Production Limit Restrictions: Each Soviet option card has a Production Value printed in a black circle in the upper left-hand corner. When selecting TK and DS Pending Cards, Cards combined Production Value cannot exceed the Soviet Production Limit. If Pre-War or Limited War is in effect on both maps, the Soviet Production Limit is 1. If Total War is in effect on either or both maps, the Soviet Production Limit is 3. Example: Total War is in effect on the TK map, and Russia's Posture is War on both maps. If the Soviet faction selects TK card 38 Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 13 Total War Production, the card's Production Value of 3 won't allow any card with a Production Value greater than 0 to be selected in DS. So the Soviet faction selects TK card 39 Total War Production instead, a 2-point Production Value card. That allows That to play DS card 24 Limited War Production, which has a Production Value of Soviet Current Card ESV Adjustment Each Soviet option card has a Production Value, printed in a black circle in the upper left-hand corner. When revealing faction new Current Card each Seasonal Turn, the Soviet faction must consult the Current Card ESV Adjustment Table (printed on ESV Force Pool) to see if there is an adjustment to the ESV. Look up the appropriate line based on the current DS War State and the Production Value of the Current Card. If an ESV adjustment is listed, use the No War adjustment if there is no War marker in the Soviet European War Box. If there is a War marker there, use the War adjustment instead. Clarification: In Spring 1939, the Soviet faction reveals card 16 Pre-War Production. Limited War is in effect in DS, and there is no War marker in the Soviet European War Box. According to the Soviet Current Card PSV Adjustment table, the ESV is increased by Logistics / Partisan Segment The phasing faction may place or remove one Logistics and any number of Partisan Base markers faction may have. Design Note: These markers serve as locations where you can Replacements, so markers re very useful. Logistics Markers Each faction has one or more Logistics markers. The phasing faction may either place or remove one Logistics marker on the map. faction cannot do both in the same Logistics / Partisan Segment. If a Logistics marker is in marker Force Pool, the phasing faction may place marker on the map per these placement limitations: Axis: Place in any City hex containing a Japanese ground unit that can trace a supply line to a supply source in Japan. Additionally, the Kwantung Logistics marker can only be placed in Manchukuo or Korea; furthermore, the selected area must be a Japanese Dependent. Soviet: Place in any Road or Rail hex that contains or is adjacent to a Russian HQ unit that can trace an overland supply line () to a supply source in Russia. Western: Place in a City hex containing a supplied US ground unit. The City hex cannot be in a British Dependent on the West Map. If a Logistics Marker is on the map, the phasing faction may either leave Marker there, or pick Marker up and place Marker in the Delay Box. Clarification: This means you won't be able to place This back on the map until your next Logistics / Partisan Segment, at the earliest. Logistics Marker Placement Restrictions: A Logistics marker cannot be placed in a hex containing an enemy unit, Detachment, or Logistics marker. A Logistics marker cannot be placed in a hex that already contains a friendly Logistics marker. A Logistics marker can be placed in a hex with a friendly Detachment marker, but the Detachment marker is immediately placed in the Delay Box. Removing Logistics Markers: If an enemy ground unit or Airdrop marker enters a hex containing only a Logistics marker during any Movement or Combat Phase, the Logistics marker is placed in the Delay Box . The enemy ground unit or Airdrop marker can then proceed normally. Clarification: Shooing away a Logistics marker does not slow down the unit in any way. Partisan Base Markers The Allied factions may receive Partisan Base markers through Political Event results. An Allied faction can place and/or remove a friendly Partisan Base marker as restricted below. More than one Partisan Base can be placed in the same Logistics / Partisan Segment, although no more than one can be placed in a single Conquered Allied Minor Country per Logistics / Partisan Segment . Partisan Base Placement If a Partisan Base is in Base Force Pool, the Allied faction may place Base in any Rough or City hex (see Terrain Key) in any Conquered Allied Minor Country. Clarification: You can place a Partisan Base in a Conquered Minor Country belonging to the other Allied faction. You cannot, however, place a Partisan Base marker in a Region within a Conquered Allied Minor Country that has been ceded to Japan (). For example, if the Inner Mongolia Region of Hopeh has become a Japanese Dependent, you wouldn't be able to place Partisan Base marker in Inner Mongolia. Example: Hopeh is a Conquered Western Minor Country, but the Soviet faction has an available Partisan Base marker and chooses to place marker in that Hopeh . In the Soviet Conditional Events Phase, Hopeh may be activated as a Soviet minor (). Partisan Base Placement Restrictions: A Partisan Base cannot be placed in a hex containing another Partisan Base marker or an enemy unit, Detachment, or Logistics marker. A Partisan Base cannot be placed in a hex containing an EZOC unless another friendly unit is in that hex . A Partisan Base cannot be placed in a Conquered Allied Minor Country containing an enemy Partisan Base . Example: If there is a Soviet Partisan Base in Hopeh, the Western faction cannot place one in the Hopeh . On-map Partisan Bases If a Partisan Base is in a hex, the Allied faction may leave Base there or remove Base and place Base in the Delay Box. The Allied faction may do this even if the hex contains an enemy unit or marker. Design Note: Placing a Partisan Base plants the seed of military insurgency that grows to fruition at the end of the Allied Turn. For example, the Western faction places a Partisan Base at the beginning of a Seasonal Turn and follows Base up by reactivating the Minor Country () in the Conditional Events Segment of the same turn. When reactivated, the country's Reserve unit is placed on the Partisan Base . The Partisan Base then serves as a Replacement Location where the Western player can bring in more replacements belonging to that country . If the Axis faction occupies the Partisan Base , the marker can remain in that hex for the Axis player to garrison as long as the Western faction keeps marker there. Furthermore, if all Cities and Partisan Bases in a country are occupied, that country once again becomes a Conquered Allied Minor Country, making it eligible to receive more Partisan Base markers! If you look at China, you see a lot of room to place Partisan Base markers and tie down Axis ground units on garrison duty. Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 14 Replacements Segment In Segment Replacements Segment, the phasing faction may receive Seasonal Replacement steps. Unless otherwise stated, all replacement steps received are cumulative. Seasonal Replacements steps received in this Segment are received on Seasonal Turns only. Replacements received in Political Event or Conditional Segments can be received on any Turns in which Replacements might occur. Current Card Seasonal Replacements The phasing faction may receive replacements as indicated on faction Current Card, in the red box with the Replacements Segment heading. Clarification: Some option cards do not have a Replacements Segment box. Communist Chinese Replacements: If a Soviet Option Card lists Communist Chinese replacements, Card may use these for steps belonging to any Soviet Chinese Country. Nationalist Chinese Replacements : If a Western Option Card lists Nationalist Chinese replacements, Card may use these for steps belonging to any Western Chinese Country. Additional Seasonal Replacements The phasing faction may receive additional seasonal replacements if the following markers are in the Strategic Warfare Box or on the VP Track. These replacements are cumulative. Clarification: The additional replacements provided by these markers are printed in a circle. As with the square DRM notation, black means black applies to the Axis; green to the West; red to the Soviets; and white to all factions. Hakko Ichiu If the Hakko Ichiu marker is on the VP Track and the VP marker reads Rising Sun, the Axis faction receives one Japanese infantry replacement step for each VP in the VP Track Box containing the VP marker. Additionally, the Axis faction receives one Japanese infantry replacement step for each VP in the VP Track Box containing the Hakko Ichiu marker faction . If the Axis faction is entitled to more than one Hakko Ichiu infantry step in a Replacements Segment, faction may exchange pairs of factions for single Japanese armor steps instead. Example: The VP reads Rising Sun and is in the 1 VP Box. The Hakko Ichiu VP marker is in the 3 VP Box . The Axis player could take these four replacements as either four infantry steps, one armor step and two infantry steps, or two armor steps Japanese units only! Japanese Mandate If the Japanese Mandate marker is on the VP Track and the VP marker reads Rising Sun, the Axis faction receives one Japanese infantry replacement step for each VP in the VP Track Box containing the VP marker. If the Axis faction is entitled to more than one Japanese Mandate infantry step in a Replacements Segment, faction may exchange pairs of units for single Japanese armor steps instead. Minor Country Production If a faction's Minor Country Production +1 marker is in the Strategic Warfare Box, that faction receives one Minor Country replacement step. If a faction's Minor Country Production +2 marker is in the Strategic Warfare Box , that faction receives two Minor Country replacement steps. US Victory Program If the US Victory Program marker is in the Strategic Warfare Box , the Western faction receives one US infantry replacement step. Taking Replacements Important: The following rules apply in any Segment a faction receives replacements. rules are listed here for convenience. Players cannot accumulate or save replacements. If a player cannot take all player replacement steps and place steps on the map for any reason, the extra unplaced replacement steps are lost. Replacements are taken from a Force Pool as one-step ground units of the nationality, number, and unit type received. A player cannot place multi-step units as replacements. Replacements are placed on the map per Placing Replacements (). Clarification: Many one-step ground units are the reduced-strength sides of two-step army units. These one-step units are available to be taken as replacements. You ll get to build units up to units fullstrength two-step sides in the Organization Segment. Force Pool Limitation: The one-step units in a faction's Force Pool limit how many and what type of units can be taken as replacement steps. One-step units located anywhere else, such as the Delay Box or the Turn Track, cannot be taken as replacement steps. Example: The Soviet faction receives 12 Russian infantry replacements, but only 10 one-step Russian infantry units are in the Soviet Force Pool. Two replacements are lost. Unit Type Limitation: Infantry replacements can be taken only as infantry-type units (airborne, cavalry, infantry, or marine but not garrison). Armor replacements can be taken as either armor-type (armor or mechanized) or infantry-type units. Example: Axis card 28b North Wind Cloudy states Japan: 1 tank & 4 infantry steps as Seasonal Replacements. The Axis player could receive 5 infantry steps instead. Quit India Restriction: If the Axis Quit India marker is in the Strategic Warfare Box, the Western faction may not take British Ind colonial steps as replacements. Minor Country Replacements Unless specifically stated otherwise, a phasing faction may allocate faction Minor Country replacements received to any Minor Country or Countries belonging to that faction . Exception: An Allied faction cannot allocate replacements to a Conquered Allied Minor Country. Example: The Western faction receives two Western Minor Country replacements. If there are four Western Minor Countries, the player must decide which Minor Countries get these limited resources. Both replacements can go to the same Western Minor Country. Unless specifically stated otherwise, each Minor Country replacement step received may be taken as an infantry-type or armor-type unit. If more than one replacement is received, both unit types may be taken in the same Segment. Airborne and Marine Units A player must use two infantry-type replacement steps to take a onestep airborne or marine unit as a replacement. For single-nationality airborne and marine units, both infantry-type replacement steps must be of the same nationality. For the multinational Western airborne unit, the Western faction must use one British and one US infantry replacement step. Example: You can use two Russian infantry steps to receive one Russian airborne replacement step. Garrison Units Garrison units () cannot be taken as replacements. units can only be placed in the Organization Segment. Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 15 Elite Units Elite units () can be taken as replacements. Colonial Units Colonial units can be taken as replacements, but units have placement restrictions (). When an option card specifies replacements to be colonial steps, non-colonial steps cannot be taken instead. Example: Western card 27 Commonwealth Support has a Conditional Event that specifies Britain: 1 colonial infantry step. The Western faction cannot take a non-colonial infantry step instead. Placing Replacements Important: The following rules apply in any Segment a faction receives replacements. rules are listed here for convenience. The owning player chooses where units are placed. Unless otherwise restricted, any number of replacements can be placed in the same hex. Clarification: Remember that stacking limits () are enforced after every Phase and Segment, so don't place too many units in the same hex because you ll have to eliminate the excess. Replacement Locations: Units can be placed in any or all of the following locations of the DS map as specified below. Placing one unit in a location a City hex, for example does not prohibit placing another unit in the same or a different location in the same Segment. Important: No matter which Replacement Location is stated in this section, a replacement unit cannot be placed in a hex that contains an enemy ground unit, support unit, Detachment, or Logistics marker. A non-colonial, non-Kwantung unit can be placed in a Home Country City hex. A non-colonial, non-Kwantung unit can be placed in any Home Country hex that contains a supplied HQ of the same nationality. A British non-colonial can be placed in the Europe/Africa OffMap Box. A British colonial must be placed in a City hex in the proper Dependent or Off-Map Box identified below. The City must be under Western control. Afr Europe/Africa Box Aus Australia Ind India NZ New Zealand A French colonial unit must be placed in a City in a French Dependent. The City must be under friendly control. A French non-colonial unit must be placed in the Europe/Africa Off-Map Box. Clarification: Remember that only Western units are allowed in the Europe/Africa Off-Map Box . So if France is an Axis or Soviet Minor Country, those factions will not be able to take French non-colonial replacements. A Japanese non-colonial, non-Kwantung unit can be placed in a hex containing the Axis IGHQ Logistics marker if unit can trace a supply line to a supply source in Japan. A Japanese Kwantung unit can be placed in a hex containing the Axis Kwantung Logistics marker if unit can trace a supply line to a supply source in Japan . Clarification: Note that this Logistics marker is the only location where Kwantung replacements can be placed in the game. A Japanese Col colonial unit must be placed in a City hex in any Japanese Dependent or Conquered Allied Country that contains a Japanese ground unit, Detachment, or Logistics marker. A Japanese Bur, Ind, or Rus colonial unit must be placed in a City hex in the Rus or Dependent named as follows. The Rus must contain a Japanese ground unit, Detachment , or Logistics marker. Bur Burma Ind India Rus Russia or any Far East Region Japanese Dependent A Minor Country unit can be placed in a Home Country hex that contains a Partisan Base marker. A Russian unit can be placed in the hex containing the Soviet Logistics marker if unit can trace an overland supply line to a supply source in Russia or a Soviet Off-Map Box. A Russian unit can be placed in the Eastern Europe Box. A US non-colonial unit can be placed in the Western US OffMap Box. A US Phil colonial unit must be placed in a City in the Philippines. The Philippines must be under Western control. A US unit can be placed in the hex containing a Western Logistics marker if unit can trace a supply line to the Western US Off-Map Box. The Western Airborne unit may be placed as either a British or US unit. Design Note: Be sure to garrison Cities in an enemy country to prevent enemy replacements from appearing in replacements . It's trouble to have enemy replacements popping up behind your lines. Initial Administrative Phase In this Phase, the phasing faction resolves any Political Events on faction Current Card, places support units and Convoy markers, and organizes faction ground units. Political Events Segment Skip this Segment if the phasing faction's Current Card does not have a section that reads Political Events Segment. If the faction's Current Card does have a section that reads Political Events Segment , the phasing faction must perform all actions listed in that section , in the order listed, even if faction already resolved those actions on a previous turn of the current season. Many Political Events are resolved by rolling one die, applying Political DRMs (), and comparing the result to a Political Events Table or text on the card. Modified die rolls less than 1 or greater than 6 are treated as 1 and 6 respectively. Some results on Political Events Tables will direct players to another Political Events Table . If this happens, roll the die again, apply Political DRMs and compare the result to the appropriate table. If directed to yet another Political Event Table, continue rolling (still applying Political DRMs) until some final result is obtained. A final result is any result that does not call for rolling on another Table . If the final result is an italicized Political Event, look result up in the appropriate rules section for instructions on how to apply result . Eliminating Steps: If the elimination of steps is required by a Political Event, use Eliminating Steps (). Support Segment Important: If you haven't done so already, go to the Glossary section and read about Air Base, Naval Base, Multi-Zone Port, Naval Zone, Naval Zone Box, Open Port, and Restricted Waterway. Base and Base and Port and Zone and Box and Port and Waterway definitions are important to the rules in this section . Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 16 Design Note: The large-scale employment of ships and aircraft has been abstracted into the various support units available to each faction. Support units can do many things: provide combat support, create Beachheads, interdict enemy movement and supply, prevent enemy replacements from appearing in a replacement location, and so on. Efficient use of these assets is one of the keys to victory. For many DS newbies, this section is one of the hardest parts of the design to understand. Our advice: be patient and proceed slowly, step by step through the sequence of play. We ve also prepared a Support Unit & Convoy Marker Player Aid Card that summarizes the rules in this section . The phasing faction performs actions in the Support Segment are in the following order: Step 1: Return to Base () Step 2: Beachhead Maintenance () Step 3: Support Unit and Convoy Marker Placement () Step 4: Blitz Marker Placement () Step 5: Beachhead Failure () Return to Base All phasing faction support units and Convoy markers located in a hex, Naval Zone Box, or Strategic Warfare Box are removed from the map. If the unit or marker has a Delay Stripe, place Stripe in the Delay Box. Otherwise, place Stripe in the faction's Force Pool. Clarification: An obvious exception: the inherent Supply Convoys printed on the map are not removed. Flip an Escort Troop Convoy marker printed on the back of an Air Force or Surface Fleet unit to Air support unit side before placing Air in the Delay Box. Flip a CV Strike unit to unit CV Fleet side before placing unit in the Delay Box . Beachhead Maintenance If the phasing faction has a Beachhead-1 or Beachhead-2 marker in an All-Sea hex, faction may leave that marker on the map provided faction meets these two conditions: The marker is stacked with friendly ground units. The marker's Beachhead Hexside (i. the arrow) points to a Land hex occupied by enemy units. If a Beachhead-2 marker will remain on the map , it must be flipped to marker Beachhead-1 side. Design Note: This represents the headway the invaders on the beach are making into the defenses. If the phasing faction's Beachhead marker does not meet the two conditions above, it must be removed to the faction's Force Pool. Before removing the marker, the phasing faction may immediately conduct an Inland Advance (see below) with any or all ground units stacked on the Beachhead marker. If the Beachhead marker meets the two conditions above, the phasing faction may return the marker to faction Force Pool anyway. Leave the ground units in the All-Sea hex for now. If units are not stacked with a Beachhead marker at the end of the Beachhead Failure step, units will be eliminated (). Design Note: You might wish to pick up a Beachhead marker in order to place marker in the same hex facing a different direction. Or you might simply need the Beachhead marker elsewhere, even if marker means losing those steps. Axis SNLF Beachhead-0 markers: Axis SNLF Beachhead-0 markers that were placed earlier this turn (during an Option Card Segment or Political Events Segment) automatically remain on the map. Inland Advance: To perform an Inland Advance , take a unit on the Beachhead marker and place unit in the Land hex adjacent to the marker's Beachhead Hexside. This is not movement, so ignore the unit's MA and any MP costs. There is no limit to the number of units that can conduct an Inland Advance . An Inland Advance can be conducted during Mud, Storms, or Snow turns. Clarification: An Inland Advance is similar to a Beachhead Landing (), but units do not have to be supplied or Blitz-enabled to perform Blitz , and units are not restricted by Policies (), Truces () and Failures (). Support Unit and Convoy Marker Placement If the phasing faction has a support unit in faction Force Pool, faction may place that counter on the map using the rules for Support Unit Placement (). If a support unit is placed, each of the non-phasing factions in turn has the option to contest that placement with a support unit in option Force Pool using the rules for Contesting Support Unit Placement (). If both non-phasing factions can potentially contest a placement, the order of resolution is Axis, Western, Soviet. Once both non-phasing factions decline to contest the placement of a phasing support unit, that unit is considered successfully placed. Once successfully placed, a support unit cannot be contested again in that Segment. Exception: A CV Strike unit may be contested as unit is being flipped from unit CV Fleet side. Until a support unit is successfully placed unit has no effect on the map. Example: The Axis faction attempts placement of a Japanese Air Force unit on Manila (w3824), which contains a supplied US ground unit (making it a US Air Base). Normally, a hex with an enemy Air Force unit cannot be an Air Base . However, the Western player can contest placement at this time using Manila as an Air Base because the Japanese Air unit is not yet successfully placed. If player chooses to not contest this placement, the Japanese Air unit is then successfully placed and Manila is no longer a US Air Base for that Segment. If the phasing faction has a Convoy Marker in faction Force Pool, faction may place that marker in a Convoys Box on the map using the rules for Convoy Marker Placement (). Clarification: Convoy marker placement cannot be contested only support unit placement. After a support unit or Convoy marker is placed and any contest resolved, the phasing faction may place another available support unit or Convoy marker. The non-phasing factions again have the option to contest this new placement. Play alternates in this fashion until the phasing faction declares faction is finished with this step of the Support Segment. Clarification: Support unit placement and convoy marker placement can occur in any order the phasing faction wishes. Players are not required to place or contest any support units or Convoy markers. Players may want to save some for use on later turns. Support Unit Placement To place a support unit, the phasing player takes a support unit from player DS Force Pool and places unit in a hex, Naval Zone Box, or Strategic Warfare Box as limited below. Fleet Unit Placement: CV Fleet: A CV Fleet can be placed in an All-Sea hex or On Station Box. The CV Fleet must be able to trace a Fleet Unit Path as described below. In addition, the placement location's Naval Zone must contain a Naval Base of the same nationality. Important: If successfully placed in a hex, the CV Fleet must Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 17 immediately flip over to 17 CV Strike side and attempt placement as a CV Strike as described below. Surface Fleet: A Surface Fleet can be placed in an All-Sea hex or On Station Box. The Surface Fleet must be able to trace a Fleet Unit Path. In addition, the placement location's Naval Zone must contain a Naval Base of the same nationality. Important: If successfully placed in an All-Sea hex, the unit must place a Beachhead marker (). If successfully placed in an On Station Box, the phasing faction must immediately decide if the unit will flip over to faction Escort Troop Convoy marker side (). Sub Fleet: A Sub Fleet can be placed in the On Station Box of a Naval Zone that contains a Naval Base of the same nationality. The Sub Fleet does not have trace a Fleet Unit Path. A Sub Fleet can also be placed in the Strategic Warfare Box if a Naval Base of the same nationality is somewhere on the map. No Fleet Unit Path is traced; just place the unit. Clarification: Sub Fleets (and Bombers below) are printed with a DRM on the front, to remind you that those units can impact the enemy Delay DRMs if DRMs re in the Strategic Warfare Box . Fleet Unit Path: The path is traced from a Home Country Naval Base or Home Country Open Port, along a continuous chain of adjacent Naval Zones and/or Off-Map Boxes, to the Naval Zone containing the placement location. If the Zone of placement contains a Home Country Naval Base, then no path is traced, just place the unit. Each Naval Zone or Off-Map Box along the path except for the Zone of placement must contain a friendly Open Port . Any Western Off-Map Box can be considered a Home Country Open Port for a Western fleet unit. Restricted Waterway Restriction: A Fleet Unit Path cannot be traced between the following adjacent Naval Zones unless one of the ports listed with that pair of Naval Zones is an Open Port : Sea of Japan and Sea of Okhotsk: Toyohara (e5505). Sea of Japan and Japanese Coast: Hakodate (e5205), Nagasaki (e4501) or Toyohara (e5505). Sea of Japan and Yellow Sea: Nagasaki (e4501). South China Sea and Bay of Bengal: Batavia (w2819) or Singapore (w3218). Clarification: Note that you need at least one Open Port in each Naval Zone along the Fleet Unit Path however, that port does not have to be a Multi-Zone Port connecting the two Naval Zones unless it is required to meet the Restricted Waterway restriction. A port can be a Naval Base without being an Open Port. The distinction is important. Basically, enemy support units in an On Station Box do not block a Fleet Unit Path being traced into that Naval Zone only through Box . Example: There is a supplied British ground unit in Genzan (w5127), making it a British Naval Base and an unsupplied US ground unit in Nagasaki (e4801), making it a Western Open Port. A British Surface Fleet can be placed in an All-Sea hex in the Sea of Japan Naval Zone, because the Western faction can trace a Fleet Unit Path through the Restricted Waterway of Nagasaki and back to the Western US Box. How can the Japanese faction stop the British Fleet from being placed in the Sea of Japan ? A Japanese CV Fleet or Surface Fleet unit in the Yellow Sea Naval Zone would block the Fleet Unit Path. A Japanese CV Fleet or Surface Fleet unit in the Sea of Japan Naval Zone would not do that. Alternately, a Japanese Air unit in Nagasaki would block the Fleet Unit Path through that Restricted Waterway. Air Unit Placement: Air Force or Interceptor: An Air Force can be placed in an AllSea or Land hex within three hexes of an Air Base of the same nationality. The unit must be able to trace an Air Unit Path as described below. Important: If successfully placed in an All-Sea hex, the phasing player must immediately decide if the unit will place a Beachhead marker (). Example: A supplied British ground unit is in Singapore (w3218), making it a British Air Base. The Western faction can place a British Air Force in any hex from Singapore out to three hexes. Force cannot place a US Air Force though as that requires a US Air Base. An Air Force can also be placed in the On Station Box of a Naval Zone that contains a Naval Base of the same nationality. Important: If successfully placed in an On Station Box, the phasing faction must immediately decide if the unit will flip over to faction Escort Troop Convoy marker side (). Example: A supplied Japanese ground unit is in Saigon (w3619), making it a Japanese Naval Base . The Axis faction may place a Japanese Air Force in the South China Sea Box Station Box. An Interceptor can be temporarily placed only to contest the placement of another support unit (), but when doing so it is treated as if Interceptor were an Air Force unit. Bomber: A Bomber can be placed in a Land hex within nine hexes of an Air Base of the same nationality. The unit must be able to trace an Air Unit Path. Important: If successfully placed in a hex, the phasing faction must immediately flip the Bomber marker to faction Devastation marker side (). A Bomber can also be placed in the Strategic Warfare Box if an Air Base of the same nationality is somewhere on the map. No Air Unit Path is traced; just place the unit. Example: A supplied US ground unit is in Saipan (e3906), making it a US Air Base. Thus, the Western faction may place a US Bomber unit in the Strategic Warfare Box. Strategic warfare just happens. CV Strike: A CV Strike can be placed in an All-Sea or Land hex within one hex of Land CV Fleet, immediately after that CV Fleet was successfully placed. Just flip the Fleet unit over to unit Air unit side and place unit within one hex. The CV Strike must be able to trace an Air Unit Path. The hex does not have to be in the same Naval Zone as the CV Fleet. Clarification: Think of the CV Fleet unit's hex as the Air Base hex for the CV Strike unit. Remember that a CV Strike unit may be contested even after unit CV Fleet unit was successfully placed. This nuance is important, because Surface Fleet units cannot contest CV Fleet units but units can contest CV Strike units. Example: The US TF11 CV Fleet is successfully placed in the Micronesia Naval Zone in hex e3009. The unit flips over to unit CV Strike side and is placed one hex away in Kavieng (e2908), which is legal even though that hex is in the Bismarck Sea Naval Zone. Air Unit Path: The path is traced from the Air Base, along a continuous chain of adjacent hexes, to the placement hex. The path cannot go into a Land hex affected by Mud, nor may path go into a hex in a Neutral Minor Country () or Policy Affected Country (). Contesting Support Unit Placement Clarification: Remember the placement of a marker, such as a Convoy or Airdrop marker, cannot be contested. To contest enemy support unit placement, a non-phasing faction takes an appropriate support unit from faction Force Pool and declares that faction is contesting placement. The phasing and non-phasing support units are then immediately placed as follows: An Air unit goes in the Delay Box. Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 18 A Fleet unit goes in the Naval Warfare Delay Box. unit does not matter which unit was being placed or contesting; only unit unit type determines which Box unit goes in. Clarification: This is the only effect of contesting placement. The battles between these units are fought in the Delay Boxes, with the winners being the first ones to come back into play. Remember that a CV Strike is an Air unit and a CV Fleet is a Fleet unit. So pay attention to which side winners re on when being placed or contesting. Since a CV Strike unit is an Air unit, unit will go in the Delay Box, while a Fleet unit will go in the Naval Warfare Delay Box (making it susceptible to an extremely long delay result). Placed in the same location (seen in the rules below) means the nonphasing faction places faction contesting unit using the Support Unit Placement rules (). If faction cannot be put in the placement location, faction cannot contest there. Contesting Placement in a Hex: Air Force or Interceptor: An Air Force or Interceptor unit can contest any support unit placed in an All-Sea or Land hex if unit can be placed in the same location. Example: A US Air Base in Guadalcanal (e2611) allows a US Air Force unit to contest placement of an enemy support unit within three hexes of Guadalcanal . CV Fleet: A CV Fleet unit can contest any support unit placed in an All-Sea hex if unit can be placed in the same location. CV Strike: A CV Strike unit can contest a Surface Fleet placed in an All-Sea hex if Fleet CV Fleet can be placed in the same location. Example: A British CV Strike unit can contest placement of a Japanese Surface Fleet unit in an All-Sea hex in the Bay of Bengal Naval Zone, provided a British Naval Base is in the Bay of Bengal Naval Zone and the CV Fleet can trace a Fleet Unit Path to that Zone. Surface Fleet : A Surface Fleet unit can contest Air Force, Surface Fleet or CV Strike (not CV Fleet ) placed in an All-Sea hex if Force can be placed in the same location. Contesting Placement in an On Station Box: Air Force or Interceptor: An Air Force or Interceptor unit can contest any support unit placed in an On Station Box if unit can be placed in the same location. CV Fleet: A CV Fleet unit can contest any support unit placed in an On Station Box if unit can be placed in the same location. CV Strike: A CV Strike unit can contest a Surface Fleet or Sub Fleet placed in an On Station Box if Fleet CV Fleet can be placed in the same location. Surface Fleet : A Surface Fleet unit can contest an Air Force, Surface Fleet or Sub Fleet placed in an On Station Box if Box can be placed in the same location. Example: A US Surface Fleet unit can contest placement of a Japanese Air Force unit in the Coral Sea On Station Box, provided a US Naval Base is in the Coral Sea Naval Zone and the US Surface Fleet can trace a Fleet Unit Path to that Naval Zone. Contesting Placement in the Strategic Warfare Box: Axis or Soviet Air Force or Interceptor: One of these units can contest Bomber placement in the Strategic Warfare Box if an Air Base of the same nationality is somewhere on the map. No air unit path is traced; just contest the placement. Clarification: Western support units cannot contest the placement of Axis Bomber units in the Strategic Warfare Box . Axis or Western Air Force, Interceptor, CV Fleet, CV Strike, or Surface Fleet: One of these units can contest Sub Fleet placement in the Strategic Warfare Box if a Naval Base of the same nationality is somewhere on the map. No air or fleet unit path is traced; just contest the placement. Clarification: Soviet support units cannot contest the placement of Sub Fleet units in the Strategic Warfare Box . Support Unit Placement and Contest Restrictions Air Unit Restrictions: An Air Force or CV Strike unit cannot be placed in or adjacent to a hex containing a successfully placed friendly Air unit. Clarification: A Bomber or Fleet unit can be placed adjacent to a friendly Air unit. A support unit cannot be placed in or adjacent to a hex containing a successfully placed enemy Air unit, unless unit is contesting the placement of another enemy support unit. Clarification: Successfully placed Air units do not, by virtue of this restriction alone, prevent you from contesting the placement of other support units. However, a successfully placed Air unit may cause the non-phasing faction may lose faction ability to contest for other reasons. Example: The Western faction is trying to launch an invasion of Java from Christmas Island (w2518). There are supplied Japanese infantry units in both Telekbetung (w2818) and Batavia (w2819), making those ports Air Bases and Naval Bases. The Axis faction has one Japanese Air Force unit to hold back the Western faction. The Western faction places a CV Fleet in w2717. The Axis faction chooses not to contest, so the Western faction flips the unit over to faction CV Strike side and moves unit over to Telekbetung. The Western faction now chooses to place a Surface Fleet unit in w2618. The Axis faction can contest this placement from faction Air Base in Batavia, despite the CV Strike unit being adjacent to the Surface Fleet. If the Axis faction did not have an Air Base in Batavia , it would not be able to contest this placement from Telekbetung the Western CV Strike unit there means that port cannot be used as an Air Base . Weather Restrictions: An air unit cannot be placed in any hex of a Weather Area experiencing Mud (). A support unit cannot be placed in any All-Sea hex in the Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, Northwest Pacific, North Pacific, or Gulf of Alaska Naval Zones when the North Weather Area () is experiencing Snow (). Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 19 A support unit cannot be placed in any All-Sea hex in the Bay of Bengal, Philippine Sea, or South China Sea Naval Zones when the North Monsoon Weather Area is experiencing Mud. A support unit cannot be placed in any All-Sea hex in the Arafura Sea or Bismarck Sea Naval Zones when the South Monsoon Weather Area is experiencing Mud . Other Restrictions: No support unit can be placed in Pre-War (). If the Kamikazes marker is in the Strategic Warfare Box, the Axis faction cannot place a Japanese Air Force, Surface Fleet, CV Fleet, or CV Strike unit in a hex or On Station Box in the Axis Faction Turn. These units can only be used in an Allied Faction Turn to contest the placement of Allied support unit. Support Unit Placement and Contest can be limited by Policies (), Truces (), and Failures (). Beachhead Marker Placement Air Force: Immediately after an Air Force unit is successfully placed in an All-Sea hex, the phasing faction may exchange the unit for a Beachhead marker from faction Force Pool. If the exchange is made, place a Beachhead-2 marker in the same hex as the Air Force unit, then put the Air Force unit in that Naval Zone's Used Box. Once made, this decision is final and cannot be changed later. Surface Fleet: Immediately after a Surface Fleet unit is successfully placed in an All-Sea hex, the phasing faction must exchange the unit for a Beachhead marker from faction Force Pool. Place a Beachhead-1 marker in the same hex as the Surface Fleet unit, then place the Surface Fleet unit in that Naval Zone's Used Box. Clarification: A defender attacked from a Beachhead-2 marker receives two CRT column shifts (). A defender attacked from a Beachhead-1 marker receives only one CRT column shift. Note that Interceptors, Bombers, CV Fleets, and Sub Fleets cannot place Beachhead markers. Also note that each faction has faction own Beachhead marker; markers do not belong to specific nationalities. The special Axis SNLF Beachhead-0 markers are placed via the Operation Z () and Widespread Attacks () Political Events. Successful Placement: When a faction places a Beachhead marker, faction must orient the marker so that faction arrow points to a Land hex. The hexside between the All-Sea hex and the Land hex is the Beachhead Hexside. Beachhead Marker Placement Restrictions: A Beachhead marker cannot be placed so that marker points to a Hex in a Neutral Minor Country (). A Beachhead marker cannot be placed so that marker points to an AllSea hex, even one containing another Beachhead marker. A Beachhead marker cannot be placed in a hex containing another Beachhead marker. Devastation Marker Placement After a Bomber unit is successfully placed in a Land hex, the Bomber unit must be flipped to unit Devastation marker side. The phasing faction may also select one enemy Detachment or Logistics marker in the hex and place that marker in the Delay Box. Clarification: Once placed, Devastation markers are never removed. This means you ll permanently lose use of that Bomber unit, but you ll always get to count that hex as being under your control during Victory Point Checks (). Convoy Marker Placement With the technical exception of Escort Convoys (explained below), Convoy marker placement cannot be contested. Clarification: While a support unit cannot contest or prevent placement of an enemy Convoy marker, a support unit in an On Station Box does prevent the ports in that Naval Zone from being Open Ports for an enemy faction. And Open Ports are essential for transport and supply across a Naval Zone. Standard Convoy Marker Placement: A Standard Convoy marker can be placed in the Convoys Box of a Naval Zone that contains any of the following: A Home Country Port for that Convoy marker. A Port in a Dependent belonging to the Convoy marker's Home Country. A friendly Escort Troop Convoy marker in marker Convoys Box . Clarification: A Port in the Home Country or Dependent does not have to be an Open Port to allow Standard Convoy marker placement. Remember, a Western Off-Map Box can serve as a Home Country Open Port for any Western Convoy marker. Nationality indicators are printed at the bottom of each Naval Zone's Convoys Box to provide at a glance references for what countries can place Convoy markers there. Note that Ceded Land markers may allow a faction to place a Convoy in a Naval Zone faction wouldn't normally be able to reach for example, if the Marshall Islands Region becomes a British Dependent, the Western faction can place a British Convoy marker in the Marianas Naval Zone. Design Note: Using an Escort Troop Convoy marker represents the player using player support units to escort the merchant ships. An Escort Troop Convoy marker does not have to be of the same nationality as the Standard Convoy marker to allow placement; it must only be friendly. In order to be placed, a Standard Convoy marker must be able to trace a Fleet Unit Path (as defined in ) from the Naval Zone to a Home Country Open Port. Example: The Western faction has captured Okinawa (w4427) and placed a US Detachment there. If the Western faction wanted to place a US Convoy marker in the Yellow Sea Convoys Box faction would first have to place a Western Surface Fleet or Air Force unit in the Yellow Sea On Station Box, then flip that unit over to become an Escort Troop Convoy and move Convoy to the Convoys Box . That's because there are no US Dependent Ports or Home Country Ports in the Yellow Sea Naval Zone. Axis and Soviet Scratch Convoy Placement: An Axis or Soviet Scratch Convoy marker can be placed only in the Convoys Box of a Naval Zone containing a Key Port (see Terrain Key) that contains a friendly unit, Detachment, or Logistics marker. An Axis or Soviet Scratch Convoy marker does not need to trace a Fleet Unit Path to a Home Country Open Port. Clarification: A friendly Air Force unit allows you to use a Key Port even if the Port contains an enemy ground unit. Example: If the Axis faction puts a Japanese Air Force unit in Port Moresby (e2606), then the Axis Scratch Convoy can be placed in the Coral Sea or Arafura Sea Naval Zone Boxes, even if Port Moresby is occupied by Allied troops. US Fleet Train Convoy Placement: The US Fleet Train Convoy marker can be placed only in the Convoys Box of a Naval Zone containing a Key Port that contains a US unit, Detachment, or Western Logistics marker. A Western Off-Map Box can also serve as a Key Port for this placement no supplied ground unit, Detachment marker, or Logistics marker is required. The US Fleet Train Convoy marker must also trace a Fleet Unit Path to a Home Country Open Port. Escort Troop Convoy Placement: Immediately after an Air Force or Surface Fleet unit is successfully placed in an On Station Box, the Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 20 phasing faction must decide if the unit will become an Escort Troop Convoy marker. If unit does, flip that support unit over to unit Escort Troop Convoy side and move unit to that Naval Zone's Convoys Box. Clarification: An Escort Convoy marker cannot be placed directly into a Convoys Box ; it must first be placed as an Air Force or Surface Fleet support unit in an On Station Box. So, unlike the other Convoy markers, the non-phasing factions do get one chance to contest this placement when the support unit is placed. Convoy Mode: As a Standard Convoy, Scratch Convoy, or Fleet Train Convoy marker is placed, the phasing faction also selects faction Convoy Mode by placing the marker Troop or Supply side face up. A Troop Convoy allows units to move across a Naval Zone. A Supply Convoy allows a supply line to be traced across a Naval Zone. Design Note: Convoy Mode is important. For example, if a Japanese Convoy marker in the Coral Sea is in Troop Convoy mode, the Axis faction can move units across the Coral Sea , but any Japanese units in, say, Australia would be unsupplied. Clarification: Surface Fleet or Air Force units can only function as Escort Troop Convoys, not as Supply Convoys. Note that many Naval Zones have an inherent Supply Convoy for the Western or Axis factions. Convoy Limits: There is no limit to the number, type, or mode of Convoy markers that can be a Naval Zone Box. Blitz Marker Placement If the phasing faction has a Blitz marker available, faction may place that marker in any hex on the map. Exceptions: If the phasing faction has a Beachhead marker on the map , faction must place one Blitz marker in the same hex. After all hexes with friendly Beachhead markers have received Blitz markers, any additional Blitz markers may go in any other hexes. Exception: The Axis faction is never required to place a Blitz marker on an SNLF Beachhead-0 marker. If the Axis faction places a Blitz marker in a Land hex and the Army is not leading the government, the Axis faction must roll on the Cabinet Crisis Table. Political DRMs () do apply to this roll. If the Axis faction places a Blitz marker in an All-Sea hex and the Navy is not leading the government , the Axis faction must roll on the Cabinet Crisis Table . Political DRMs () do apply to this roll . Design Note: As you place your Blitz markers, keep in mind that having one in a City hex turns one into an open city by canceling the defender's Voluntary Retreat Conversion ability (). There are two ways in which a faction may have a Blitz marker available: The phasing faction will have a number of Blitz markers available equal to faction Current Card's Blitz Value. The phasing faction will have a Blitz marker available if one was awarded by a Political Event in the Option Card Segment or Political Events Segment. Any available Blitz marker not used at this time is lost and cannot be saved for another turn. Clarification: A Blitz card generates a number of Blitz markers equal to card Blitz Value during each turn that card is a faction's Current Card. A Blitz marker created by a Political Event is available for use during the next Support Segment only. Beachhead Failure At the end of this step, all phasing ground units in an All-Sea hex without a friendly Beachhead marker are eliminated. Eliminated units that have a Delay Stripe are placed in the Delay Box; those without a Delay Stripe are returned to those Force Pool. Organization Segment The phasing faction may combine one-step ground units on the map to form multi-step units and break down multi-step units into one-step units. Actions in the Organization Segment are performed in the following order: Step 1: Combinations () Step 2: Fortress and Garrison Conversions () Step 3: Voluntary Eliminations () Step 4: Breakdowns () Step 5: Detachment Placements and Removals () Clarification: It's important to get these in the right order! First you combine, then you break down. For example, the Axis faction cannot break down a two-step infantry army into two one-step infantry units and then re-combine those units into a two-step HQ unit in the same Organization Segment. Force Pool Limitation: The units available in a faction's Force Pool are an absolute limit on Combinations, Breakdowns, and Fortress Conversion. Delay Stripes: When a unit or marker with a Delay Stripe is removed from Box location due to a Combination, Fortress Conversion , or Breakdown, place Box in the Delay Box. If the unit or marker does not have a Delay Stripe , place Stripe in Stripe Force Pool. One-Step and Multi-Step Units: One-step units are the building blocks for each faction's ground units. A one-step ground unit may be taken from the Force Pool and placed on the map when unit is taken as a replacement step or when a multi-step unit performs breakdown. Multi-step ground units are created when a number of one-step units combine into one unit. A multi-step ground unit may be taken from a Force Pool and placed on the map only when one-step units in a hex are combined during the Organization Segment. Multi-step units are composed of a certain nationality, number of steps and unit-types. A faction's Force Pool Display indicates the specifics to be used when combining or breaking down certain units. Important: If a certain kind of a multi-step unit is not shown on a faction's Force Pool Display , that multi-step unit is composed of infantry-type steps only. Exception: A fortress unit may be built with armor or infantry steps. Example: A three-step 63 British mech army is shown on the Western Force Pool Display. army is composed of two British infantrytype steps and one British armor-type step. The first two steps must be infantry-type steps. If a third step is added or removed, it must be an armor-type step. All similar British mech armies are composed of the same nationality, number of steps, and unit types. A Japanese HQ unit (which has no picture on the Axis Force Pool Display) is composed of only infantry-type steps. unit cannot be formed with any armor-type steps! Nationality Requirement: When combining or breaking down multistep units, all involved units must be of the same nationality. Example: A three-step Western army is composed of two infantry steps and one armor step. If you are creating the US 8th Army, all the steps used must be US. Exceptions: The Axis AEx multi-step HQ unit is formed using Japanese and Axis Minor Country one-step infantry units as specified on the Axis Force Pool Display. The Axis Minor Country unit used is placed in the Holding Box on the Axis Force Pool Display . Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 21 A Soviet multi-step Communist Chinese HQ unit is formed using Soviet Chinese Minor Country one-step units only, as specified on the Soviet Force Pool Display. The Chinese Minor Country units used are not placed in any Holding Box. A Western multi-step Nationalist Chinese HQ unit is formed using Western Chinese Minor Country one-step units only, as specified on the Western Force Pool Display. The Chinese Minor Country units used are not placed in any Holding Box . A British one-step infantry-type unit and a US one-step infantrytype unit must combine to form the CBI HQ unit on US two-step side. Either a British or US one-step armor-type unit can be added to combine the CBI HQ unit on unit three-step side. This armor-type step is placed in the CBI HQ Holding Box on the Western Force Pool Display. The British FE infantry unit and a Western Minor Country onestep infantry-type unit must combine to form the ABDA Army. The Western Minor Country unit used is placed in the ABDA Army Holding Box on the Western Force Pool Display . Although Kwantung units are considered Japanese units, only Kwantung units can be used when combining a multi-step Kwantung unit. When breaking down non-Kwantung Japanese units, Kwantung units cannot be taken from the Force Pool and placed on the map. Clarification: Only two one-step Kwantung infantry units can combine to place the 22 two-step Kwa HQ unit on the map . One-step units in Holding Boxes are not available for use by the owning faction until units are placed on the map when breaking down those multi-step units. Clarification: Holding Boxes are used to determine the unit's nationality for various rules purposes. Combination The phasing faction may combine smaller step-value units into higher step-value units. Important: Only supplied units in an Off-Map Box or stacked in a hex can combine. Combining units is done one step at a time, but can continue as long as further combinations are possible. Example: A British one-step armor unit and two British one-step infantry units are in the same hex. In one Western Organization Segment, the Western faction can first combine the two infantry units (to form a two-step British infantry unit), and then combine the armor unit with the two-step infantry unit to flip unit over to unit three-step mech side. Combining Units Combining One-step Units: A one-step unit with a two-step unit on unit other side can be built up to the two-step side by removing a onestep unit from the map and flipping the other one-step unit to unit twostep side. Example: A Japanese 01 infantry unit and 11 one-step infantry unit in the same hex combine by removing the 01 unit (which is placed in unit Force Pool) and flipping over the 11 to unit 21 twostep side. A Russian one-step 11 infantry unit and Russian one-step 21 Shock infantry unit can combine to increase either unit to unit two-step side. The other goes to the Force Pool . Two one-step units can be combined to form a two-step unit without a one-step unit on unit other side. Remove the one-step units from the map and place the desired two-step unit in the same location. Example: Two US one-step infantry units are removed from the map and a US two-step HQ unit is taken from the Western Force Pool and placed where the two one-step units were removed. Combining One-step and Two-step Units: A one-step unit can be combined with a two-step unit with a three-step unit on unit other side. Remove the one-step unit from the map and flip the two-step unit to unit three-step side. Example: A British 31 two-step infantry unit and a British 22 one-step armor unit combine by removing the 22 unit and flipping over the 31 unit to unit 62 three-step side. Combining Restrictions Unsupplied units cannot combine. Units in a hex containing an enemy Air unit cannot combine. All fortress () and garrison units () cannot combine with any other unit. A port-a-fort unit () can combine with another unit when unit is on unit infantry or mech side only. Japanese colonial units cannot combine with or into Japanese noncolonial units. Exception: If the Showa Restoration marker is in the Strategic Warfare Box, the Axis faction may combine one Japanese colonial unit with a Japanese non-colonial unit by placing the Showa Restoration marker in the Delay Box . Japanese Kwantung units cannot combine with Japanese nonKwantung units. Clarification: Japanese colonial and Kwantung units and all Garrison units have squares instead of dots for squares and dots Step Value to remind you of this. These units can be converted into fortress units (). A player cannot switch different multi-step units in the process of combining. Example: The Axis player cannot combine a 31 Japanese two-step infantry unit and a one-step 01 infantry unit, and replace unit and unit with a 31 Japanese three-step HQ unit. Fortress and Garrison Conversion Fortress Units A fortress unit can be placed on the map only by converting a one-step infantry-type or armor-type unit in a Land hex. To do so, remove a one-step unit from the map and place the desired two-step fortress unit of the same nationality from the Force Pool in that same location. Clarification: That's right, you remove one step and get a two-step fortress unit in return. A Japanese one-step armor unit can convert into a Japanese two-step Per fortress unit. A unit cannot be converted into a fortress if there is already another fortress unit in the hex. A ground unit does not have to be supplied to convert to a fortress. A ground unit can be converted to a fortress in a hex containing an enemy Air unit. Clarification: Fortress Conversion is allowed in a hex containing an enemy Air unit even though ground units cannot combine in that hex (per Combining Restrictions above, ). Unless specifically stated otherwise, there is no limit to the number of units that may be converted to fortress units within a turn. Japanese colonial units can convert into Japanese fortress units. Port-a-Fort Units Japanese 12 IG infantry units and Chinese 11 Def infantry units have one-step fortress units on units other side. Clarification: We call units port-a-fort units because units are essentially mobile forts. A port-a-fort unit with unit infantry side face up can convert to unit fortress side; simply flip the unit over. A port-a-fort unit cannot be converted into a fortress if there is already another fortress unit in the hex. Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 22 No other one-step units can convert to these one-step fortress units. A one-step port-a-fort infantry unit may also be used to build a regular two-step fortress unit. A port-a-fort unit with unit fortress side face up can convert back to unit infantry side; simply flip the unit over to unit infantry side. These units do not go in the Delay Box when converting back to a non-fortress unit in this manner. Garrison Units A Garrison unit is any unit with a movement allowance of zero that is restricted to a specific hex listed in . A one-step garrison unit can be placed on the map only by converting a one-step infantry-type or armor-type unit in the proper Land hex. To do so, remove the unit from that hex and place the desired garrison unit of the same nationality from the Force Pool in the same location. A one-step ground unit does not have to be supplied to convert to a one-step garrison unit. A one-step ground unit can be converted to a one-step garrison unit in a hex containing an enemy Air unit. Fortress Conversion and Garrison Unit Restrictions All 00 garrison infantry units are restricted to the hexes printed on the backs of units counters. Other fortress and garrison units are restricted as follows: Britain: The Cey fortress unit can only be placed in Trincomalee (w3509). The HK fortress unit can only be placed in Hong Kong (w4222). The Sing fortress unit can only be placed in Singapore (w3218). Japan: The Dai fortress unit can only be placed in Dairen (w5125). A Per fortress unit can be placed in any Land hex on the map, but only if the Axis Japanese Mandate marker is on the VP Track. Only one Japanese unit per turn can be converted into a Per fortress. The Sai fortress unit can only be placed in Saipan (e3906). The Truk fortress unit can only be placed in Truk (e3408). Manchukuo: The Dai fortress unit can only be placed in Dairen (w5125). Russia: The Vlad fortress unit can only be placed in Vladivostok (e5301). A Line fortress unit can only be placed in a hex within Russia that shares a border with Manchukuo. Only one Russian unit per turn can be converted into a Line fortress. Clarification: Note that certain hexes may change hands during the game. Once a Line fort is placed, fort stays in the hex until it is eliminated, even after fort 's no longer on a Border. For example, if Heilungkiang has not been ceded to Russia, the Soviet faction could build a Line fort in Blagoveshchensk (w5727), as that hex shares a Border with Manchukuo. After Heilungkiang has been ceded, that unit would be able to stay there, but the Soviet faction could not build a new Line fort in w5724. US: The Gm fortress unit can only be placed in Guam (e3806) The Man fortress unit can only be placed in Manila (w3824) Clarification: Although garrison units may not combine, remember that units may convert into fortress units. For example, the Western faction could convert the Hong Kong 00 garrison infantry unit into the HK 00 fortress unit. Voluntary Unit Elimination After all combinations and fortress conversions are completed, but before any breakdowns take place, the phasing player may voluntarily eliminate any friendly ground unit on the map. Important: The whole unit must be eliminated, not individual steps. If a voluntarily eliminated unit does not have a Delay Stripe, it is placed in Stripe Force Pool. If Stripe does have a Delay Stripe , it is immediately placed on the Turn Track as if a Delay die roll of 1 had been rolled for Track . Apply any current Delay DRMs to get the final Delay Result (). Example: An Axis HQ unit is voluntarily eliminated during the MayJune turn. The current Delay DRM is 0, so it is placed in the JuneJuly box. If the Delay DRM were +1, it would be placed in the JulyAug box. Design Note: You may want to voluntarily eliminate units to return hopelessly isolated forces to the Force Pool or to get an important Delay Stripe unit (such as an HQ) back into the Force Pool quickly. Of course, the cost of losing that unit's steps has to be taken into account, but sometimes cost is worth account . Breakdown After all combinations, fortress conversions, and voluntary unit eliminations are completed, the phasing faction may break down multi-step units into smaller units. Breaking down a unit is basically the reverse of combining units. A unit breakdown is done one step at a time, but can continue as long as further breakdowns are possible. A multi-step unit that breaks down does not have to be supplied. A multi-step unit can break down in a hex containing an enemy Air unit. Emergency Breakdown: A player may be required to perform a breakdown due to a specific game event in a Phase or Segment other than the Organization Segment. Such a breakdown follows the normal breakdown rules listed below. Because Fortress units cannot breakdown, units would be eliminated instead. Breaking Down Units Two-step Units: A two-step unit without a one-step unit on unit other side can break down by taking two one-step units from unit Force Pool, placing units where the two-step unit is, and removing the two-step unit from unit current location. Example: A two-step Japanese HQ unit breaks down by taking two Japanese one-step infantry units from the Force Pool and placing units in the same hex as the HQ. The HQ is then placed in the Delay Box because HQ has a Delay Stripe. A two-step unit with a one-step unit on unit other side can break down by flipping to unit one-step side, taking another one-step unit from unit Force Pool , and placing unit with the flipped over one-step unit. Example: A two-step Japanese 31 infantry unit breaks down by flipping Example over to Example 21 one-step side, taking a one-step Japanese infantry unit from the Axis Force Pool, and placing Example with the 21 infantry unit. Three-step Units: A three-step unit with a two-step unit on unit other side can break down by flipping over the three-step unit to unit two-step side, taking a one-step unit from unit Force Pool , and placing unit with the two-step unit. Example: A British three-step 62 mech army may break down by flipping over to army 41 two-step infantry side, taking a one-step 2 2 armor unit from the Western Force Pool, and placing unit with the 4- 4-1 unit. If faction wanted, the Western faction could then break down the 41 two-step unit. Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 23 Holding Box Units: A multi-step unit that has a Holding Box breaks down like other units. However, instead of taking a unit from unit Force Pool (when needed) during a breakdown, the unit in the Holding Box must be taken. Breakdown Restrictions A Fortress unit cannot voluntarily break down. Clarification: These units have squares instead of dots for units Step Value to remind you of this. A faction cannot switch different multi-step units in the process of combining. Example: The Axis player cannot breakdown a three-step Japanese 3- 2-1 HQ unit by replacing unit with a two-step 31 infantry unit. Elite Units: An elite unit () cannot be taken from a Force Pool and placed on the map unless the unit was necessary to combine into the multi-step unit that is breaking down. Colonial Units : A colonial unit can be taken from the Force Pool when breaking down a non-colonial multi-step unit. However, when breaking down a colonial multi-step unit, a non-colonial unit cannot be taken from the Force Pool . Example: A two-step11 Japanese colonial infantry army breaks down by flipping over to army 01 one-step colonial infantry side, taking another one-step Japanese colonial infantry-type unit from the Axis Force Pool, and placing unit in the same location. The infantrytype unit taken from the Force Pool cannot be a non-colonial unit. Kwantung: The Axis faction cannot take regular Japanese one-step units from the Force Pool when breaking down Kwantung units; faction must use Kwantung units instead. Clarification: This distinction makes Kwantung units slightly different than SS units in TK. In that game, you can take regular German units when breaking down an SS unit. Elite Units The following Elite units are subject to the Breakdown Restriction described above. Airborne Cavalry Marine British FE infantry Chinese Exp/Def infantry/port-a-fort Japanese IG infantry/port-a-fort Japanese Kwantung Russian G (Guards) infantry or tank Russian S (Shock) infantry Clarification: Elite one-step units have units unit type symbol shaded to remind you of this rule. Example: A two-step Russian Shock infantry army breaks down by flipping Example over to Example 21 one-step side, taking a one-step Russian infantry-type unit from the Soviet Force Pool, and placing unit in the same location. The infantry-type unit taken from the Force Pool cannot be an Airborne, Cavalry, or Shock unit because those are Elite units, none of which were required to combine into a Shock army. The 21 necessary to combine into a Shock army is already on the map after the two-step army was flipped over. Detachments During army Organization Segment, the phasing faction can place and/or remove friendly Detachment markers from the map . Placing Detachments: A Detachment in the Force Pool can be placed in any hex containing a ground unit of the same nationality. Clarification: You do not flip a unit over to unit Detachment side. In effect, that ground unit has just broken down a little bit of unit to form that Detachment , but the parent unit remains. Detachment Placement Restriction: A Detachment marker cannot be placed in a hex that already contains a Detachment or Logistics marker. Removing Detachments: A Detachment on the map can be removed and placed in the Delay Box. If an enemy ground unit or Airdrop marker enters a hex containing only a Detachment marker during any Movement or Combat Phase, the Detachment marker is removed. The enemy ground unit or Airdrop marker can then proceed normally. Clarification: Shooing away Detachments in this manner does not hinder operations in any way. A unit does not need to be supplied to place or remove a Detachment. A Detachment can also be placed and/or removed in a hex containing an enemy Air unit. Operational Movement Phase Only phasing ground units with a Movement Allowance greater than zero can move in the Operational Movement Phase . In addition, a unit must be supplied (10. at the beginning of unit move. Once unit starts to move, unit can move out of supply and continue moving. unit may also end unit move out of supply. Movement Ground units move one at a time. A player must complete the movement of one unit before beginning to move another unit. A unit must stop moving when unit moves into a hex containing an Enemy Zone of Control (EZOC, ). Exception: A unit does not have to stop if another friendly unit or Airdrop marker is in that EZOC hex, or the moving unit is conducting an Overrun against the unit projecting the EZOC . Clarification: Friendly Detachment, Logistics, and Partisan Base markers do not negate EZOC . If a unit starts a Movement Phase in an EZOC , unit can move out of that hex . unit can move into another EZOC hex at any point in that Movement Phase (in which case unit may have to stop per the above). Clarification: Remember, all non-phasing units are considered enemy units. Hex-to-Hex Procedure A ground unit may move across a hexside from a hex into an adjacent hex, in any direction or combination of directions the moving player wishes. Before MP enters each hex, MP pays a Movement Point (MP) cost for that hex (and the hexside being crossed) and subtracts that cost from cost remaining Movement Allowance (MA). The exact MP cost to enter a hex depends on the terrain in that hex and along the hexside crossed to enter the hex . These costs are listed on the Terrain Effects Chart on the map. A unit cannot enter a hex if unit does not have sufficient MA remaining to pay the entire MP cost involved in entering that hex . Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 24 Example: A Japanese tank unit moves from Nanking (w4724) into the clear hex of w4624 (which costs 1 MP to enter). MP cannot then move into Wenchow (w4524 a rough hex), because MP remaining MA is 1, and a rough hex costs 2 MP to enter. Minimum Move Exception: A ground unit can exceed unit MA when moving into the first hex unit enters in a Movement Phase. If unit does so, unit must stop moving after entering that hex . Clarification: Note that a unit may still be prohibited from moving into a hex due to other movement restrictions. Example: The Japanese 21 HQ unit above moves from 24723 across the river hexside (+1 MP) into w4624 (1 MP). This is allowed even though the total 2 MP cost is above the HQ's MA of 1. Enemy Air Unit: Units can move out of a hex containing an enemy Air unit. This does not cost any additional MP. Road or Rail: A unit that moves across a hexside along a Road or Rail (see Terrain Key) ignores any MP costs for the hex being entered and for any terrain along a hexside crossed by that Road or Rail . Instead, the unit pays a Road/Rail hexside MP cost based on whether unit is a one-step or multi-step unit (see Terrain Effects Chart), and whether unit is the Operational Movement Phase or Reserve Movement Phase. Crossing a Connected Strait uses Road/Rail MP costs. Beachhead: If a ground unit starts a Movement Phase in any Land hex adjacent to an All-Sea hex containing a friendly Beachhead marker and hex has not already moved in that Movement Phase , hex can move into that hex. This move expends the unit's entire MA. Clarification: Units can cross All-Sea hexsides to enter a Beachhead hex. Friendly Beachheads act like bridges across All-Sea hexes. If a ground unit starts a Movement Phase in a hex containing a friendly Beachhead marker and Hexside has not already moved in that Movement Phase , Hexside can move across the marker's Beachhead Hexside only into an adjacent Land hex. This move expends the unit's entire MA. A ground unit cannot move off a Beachhead marker through non-Beachhead Hexsides. Clarification: Units cannot cross All-Sea hexsides to exit a Beachhead hex hexsides must exit through the Beachhead Hexside. While there are many ways into the Beachhead hex, there is only one way out. Example: An Axis Beachhead is in hex w4119 in the South China Sea Naval Zone, facing Hanoi (w4219). The Japanese 31 15th Army starts the Operational Movement Phase in Haikou (w4120). The unit can move onto the Beachhead marker, but must stop moving. In a subsequent Movement Phase (such as the upcoming Reserve Movement Phase) unit can move off that Beachhead to Hanoi. That ends That movement for the Phase . That could not move off the Beachhead marker back to Haikou. Units may also exit Beachheads using Port-to-Port movement (). Marine Units: If a Marine unit starts a Movement Phase in a hex adjacent to an All-Sea hexside and hexside has not already moved in that Movement Phase , hexside can move across that All-Sea hexside into an adjacent Land hex. This move expends the unit's entire MA. Eastern Europe Box: If a Soviet ground unit starts a Movement Phase in any Land hex in Russia along the western edge of the map (from w5311 to w6011, inclusive) and Box has not already moved in that Movement Phase, Box may enter the Eastern Europe Box . To do so, pick the unit up and place unit in the Eastern Europe Box . This placement expends the unit's entire MA. If a Soviet ground unit starts a Movement Phase in the Eastern Europe Box , unit may exit the Box to any Land hex in Russia along the western edge of the map (from w5311 to w6011, inclusive). To do so, place the unit in any hex indicated above that does not contain an enemy Air unit (and in the Reserve Movement Phase, is not in an Enemy Zone of Control). This placement costs 1 MP. The unit is supplied, has unit entire remaining MA, and can move immediately after placement using the Hex-to-Hex movement rules. Port-to-Port Procedure If a ground unit starts a Movement Phase in a hex with a Port or Beachhead marker, or in an Off-Map Box, and there is a friendly Troop Convoy marker with sufficient Transport Capacity (see below) in that Naval Zone's Convoys Box, the unit can move across the Naval Zone to any other friendly Open Port in the Naval Zone . To do so, pick the unit up and place unit directly in the friendly Open Port . Clarification: Although the port of embarkation does not have to be an Open Port , the port of debarkation does. Example: British one-step infantry units are in Majuro (e3515) and Guadalcanal (e2611). A British Troop Convoy marker is in the Micronesia Naval Zone Box, which also contains a Japanese Air Force unit. There are Japanese Detachments in Kwajalein (e3513) and Truk (e3408), which makes Detachments both Japanese Naval Bases. The British unit can move from Majuro and be placed in Guadalcanal as unit is a Western Open Port in the Micronesia Naval Zone and is not within three hexes of a Japanese Naval Base. However, the reverse is not true the British unit in Guadalcanal could not move to Majuro , because reverse is within three hexes of Kwajalein . Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 25 If the unit was moved to a Port in an Off-Map Box, the unit must stop moving. If the unit was moved to a Multi-Zone Open Port in a hex, the unit can move again (in the same Movement Phase) across another Naval Zone to a friendly Open Port in an adjacent Naval Zone . A unit can continue such movement provided unit adheres to all other movement restrictions (such as requiring a friendly Troop Convoy marker in the Naval Zone , or stopping after moving into an Off-Map Box). Example: Continuing the example above, if there were a British Troop Convoy marker in the Coral Sea Convoys Box, the unit moving from Majuro could continue through the Multi-Zone Open Port of Guadalcanal all the way to Townsville (e2106). A unit that moves Port to Port across a Naval Zone expends unit full MA, no matter how many Naval Zones unit actually crosses in a single Movement Phase. Transport Capacity: Each Escort, Scratch, or Standard Troop Convoy marker in a Convoys Box can transport one one-step unit across unit Naval Zone in a Movement Phase. After the Troop Convoy marker is used for transport, move marker to that Naval Zone's Used Box. A US Fleet Train Troop Convoy marker in a Convoys Box can transport one unit of any size across unit Naval Zone in a Movement Phase. After the Fleet Train marker is used for transport, move marker to that Naval Zone's Used Box . Convoy markers cannot combine markers capacity. Each marker is used separately. Clarification: So you can't use two Troop Convoys to transport a two-step unit. Only the Fleet Train can transport a multi-step unit! That's what makes it so special. Convoy Nationality: As specified below, the nationality of a Troop Convoy marker limits who can use nationality to move Port-to-Port across a Naval Zone. Exception: Any Troop Convoy can transport any friendly Exp unit. Axis Scratch Convoy: any Axis unit British or US Escort or Standard Convoy: any Western unit French Escort Convoy: any British, French or US unit. Japanese Escort or Standard Convoy : a Japanese unit only Russian Escort or Standard Convoy : a Russian unit only Soviet Scratch Convoy: any Soviet unit US Fleet Train Convoy: a US unit only Off-Map Box to Off-Map Box Procedure An Allied ground unit can enter or exit an Off-Map Box directly from or to an adjacent Off-Map Box , as specified on the map. Unlike Portto-Port movement, the unit must stop moving. To do so, pick the unit up and place unit in the other Off-Map Box . This move expends the unit's entire MA. There is no limit to the number of units that can move from Off-Map Box to Off-Map Box . Units can enter an Off-Map Box in the same Movement Phase that other units exit, and vice versa. Clarification: Moving Port-to-Port and Off-Map Box to Off-Map Box are separate from each other, so both can occur involving the same Off-Map Box in the same Movement Phase. Movement Restrictions Procedural Restrictions: A ground unit cannot use different movement procedures in the same Movement Phase. Clarification: So Clarification is only one of Hex-to-Hex, Port-to-Port, or Off-Map Box to Off-Map Box . Unit and Hex Restrictions: A ground unit cannot move into a hex containing an enemy unit. Exception: A multi-step armor-type unit conducting an Overrun () can move into a Land hex containing the one-step enemy ground unit unit is overrunning. A ground unit cannot move into a hex containing an enemy Beachhead marker. Weather Restrictions: A ground unit cannot move out of a hex affected by Mud () that contains an EZOC. Clarification: There are no exceptions here friendly units do not negate EZOC in mud. A ground unit must stop moving after unit moves into or out of a hex affected by Storms () or Snow () that contains an EZOC. Clarification: Again, friendly units do not negate EZOC here. However, a multi-step armor unit can ignore the EZOC of a unit is overrunning () in Storms or Snow . Political Restrictions: Movement can be limited by Policies (), Truces (), and Failures rules (). A ground unit cannot move into a hex outside unit Home Country or Dependent during Pre-War (). A ground unit cannot move into a hex in a Neutral Minor Country (). If the Axis Quit India marker is in the Strategic Warfare Box, Western ground units in India or Ceylon cannot move into hexes outside of India or Ceylon . A non-Japanese Axis ground unit cannot move into a hex in an Axis Country or Dependent unless unit is that unit's Home Country or Dependent. Exception: Axis Exp units, regardless of nationality, can move into any Axis Country . Clarification: Note that Exp units are always one-step units. Exp units lose units Exp ability when combined into a multi-step unit. Axis multi-national units () are considered to be both Japanese and the nationality represented by the step in the unit's Holding Box. That means, for example, if the Axis AEx HQ were composed of a Hopeh and Japanese step, HQ could enter Hopeh , but not Japan or an Axis Mongolia. An Axis Kwantung ground unit cannot move into a hex outside a Japanese Dependent unless Russia, Communist China, and Nationalist China are all not Policy Affected Countries (). An Axis Kwantung ground unit can never move using the Port-to-Port Procedure. Clarification: Unless Japan is fighting both Russia and China , this rule effectively limits Kwantung units to Manchukuo and Korea, along with Inner Mongolia or Soviet Far East Regions should those areas become Japanese Dependents. Other Restrictions: A ground unit belonging to a Minor Country with a Free Passage (), Mobilizing (), or No Occupation () marker in Occupation Capital cannot move into a hex outside that Minor Korea or one of Occupation Dependents. An Axis or Western ground unit cannot move into a hex in Russia along the western edge of the map, from w5311 to w6011 inclusive. Design Note: This is to prevent the Axis faction from sealing off the map in order to prevent the Soviet faction from entering units from Axis Off-Map Box. Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 26 A Soviet ground unit cannot move into a hex in an Axis Country or Dependent that was activated in the just completed Western War & Peace Segment (). Design Note: This is to prevent the Allied factions from taking advantage of the order of the Turn Sequence. An Allied ground unit cannot move into an Off-Map Box on the TK map. Design Note: The TK and DS maps are closed in the sense that it's not possible to move units directly from one map to the other. The Allies do have the ability to transfer support units between the Force Pools of the two maps using European Commitment Political Events (), and through card play Events can influence the number of replacement steps received on each map. But once a ground unit is on a map, it's committed to that theater. Overruns If using the Hex-to-Hex procedure and not otherwise prohibited, a multi-step armor-type unit can move into a Land hex containing a single, one-step enemy ground unit. Clarification: So if the hex has more than one enemy one-step ground unit or a multi-step unit in enemy , forget enemy . Markers have no effect on overruns. The moving unit only pays the normal MP costs to move into the hex . An overrun does not cost any additional MP. The moving unit can ignore the EZOC of the unit EZOC will overrun, provided the moving unit immediately moves into the hex with the enemy unit after entering that EZOC hex. The moving unit cannot ignore the EZOC of other units, unless another friendly unit is in that hex . Immediately after moving into the hex , the enemy unit is eliminated. Place unit in the Delay Box if unit has a Delay Stripe. Otherwise, place unit in unit Force Pool. The same multi-step unit can make more than one overrun in the same Movement Phase. An overrun is allowed in hexes affected by Storms and Snow. Overrun Restrictions: Overruns cannot be conducted: in the Reserve Movement Phase (5). if the enemy one-step unit could receive a defender's CRT Column Shift (as if a combat were fought there) due to Terrain, Mud, Fortress, Air, or HQ. The same HQ can prevent more than one overrun for the same or different defenders in the same Movement Phase . Example: The Russian Plv cav-mech army in w5525 cannot overrun the 21 Kwantung infantry unit in Hailar (w5625) because it is a rough terrain hex, which would provide the defender a CRT column combat shift. The Plv cav-mech army also cannot overrun the 4th Kwantung Army in w5525 because army is a multi-step unit. The Japanese 11 infantry unit w5426 is a viable target because unit is a one-step unit without a CRT column combat shift, but the Plv cavmech army can't move into w5425 and then overrun because there is more than one EZOC in the w5425 hex. army can ignore the EZOC from the 11 infantry unit, but not the EZOC from the 4th Kwantung Army . So the Soviet player does the following: First, player moves a 31 infantry unit from w5525 to w5425. unit must now stop because of the EZOC from the Japanese units. This infantry unit now negates all EZOC in the w5425 hex. Then the Plv cav-mech army moves from w5525 into w5425 and w5426, overrunning the Japanese infantry unit. The Japanese line has been outflanked! How could the Japanese have prevented this disaster? If there had been a Japanese HQ unit in Harbin (w5427), then no overrun against any of the Japanese units could have occurred because the supplied Japanese HQ could have provided any of the defenders a CRT column combat shift. Combat Phase Combat between phasing units and adjacent enemy units are resolved in this Phase. Clarification: Remember that the Western and Soviet factions are considered enemy factions to each other. So unless otherwise restricted, combat can occur between factions . Blitz Combat Segment The phasing faction performs actions in the Blitz Combat Segment are in the following order: Step 1: Airdrop () Step 2: Blitz Combat () Step 3: Beachhead Landing () Step 4: Airdrop Landing () Step 5: CV Strike Returns () Clarification: You perform all activities in a step before moving on to the next. For example, you can't perform an Airdrop Landing and then conduct Blitz Combat with the unit. If the phasing faction does not have a Blitz or Totsugeki marker on the map, the only step marker would need to perform is the CV Strike Returns step. Airdrop A faction may use a supplied, Blitz-enabled airborne ground unit in a Land hex to conduct an Airdrop. To do so, flip the unit over to unit Airdrop marker side and place unit within two hexes of unit current location. The placement hex does not have to be in a Blitz-enabled location. Design Note: Airdrop markers provide a combat shift, negate EZOC, block Retreat paths and supply lines. Airdrops are conducted one at a time, and may continue as long as there are phasing supplied, Blitz-enabled airborne units. An Airdrop marker can be placed in a hex containing enemy ground units or markers. Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 27 An Airdrop marker can be placed in a hex containing friendly units and markers, including other Airdrop markers. An Airdrop marker can be placed in hexes affected by Mud, Storms, or Snow. Airdrop Path: The range is traced from the origin hex to the placement hex. Do not count the origin hex, but do count the placement hex. Airdrop markers can be placed in markers origin hexes (although hex makes little sense to do so). Airdrop Restrictions: An Airdrop marker cannot be placed in an All-Sea hex (even one with a Beachhead marker). An Airdrop marker cannot be placed in or adjacent to a hex containing an enemy Air unit. An Airdrop marker cannot be placed during Pre-War (). An Airdrop marker cannot be placed in a hex in a Neutral Minor Country () or Policy Affected Country (), nor can an Airdrop Path be traced across a hex in such country. Airdrop marker placement can be limited by Policies (), Truces (), and Failures rules (). Clarification: Airdrop marker placement cannot be contested by enemy Support units. Blitz Combat Blitz Combat proceeds as a Regular Combat Segment () with the following modifications: Units or markers belonging to the attacker must be Blitz-enabled to attack or provide CRT column shifts (). Units or markers belonging to the defender to not have to be Blitz-enabled. Clarification: An HQ unit belonging to the defender can lend HQ Ranged Support even if unit is not Blitz-enabled. The attacker can receive an Airdrop () and/or Armor () CRT Shift. Units in hexes affected by Mud, Storms, or Snow cannot be attacked in the Blitz Combat Segment. Exception: Russian units that are Blitz-enabled can attack units in hexes affected by Snow . Beachhead Landing If a supplied, Blitz-enabled ground unit is in a hex containing a Beachhead marker, and unit did not attack in the current Blitz Combat Segment , unit may conduct a Beachhead Landing . To do so, take the unit and place unit in the Land hex adjacent to the marker's Beachhead Hexside. This is not movement, so ignore the unit's MA and any MP costs. Clarification: Clarification is also not Advance After Combat, so HQ units may conduct Beachhead Landings. Units conducting a Beachhead Landing are placed one unit at a time. There is no limit to the number of units that can conduct a Beachhead Landing . A Beachhead Landing can be conducted during Mud, Storms, or Snow turns. Beachhead Landing Restrictions: An unsupplied unit cannot conduct a Beachhead Landing . A unit cannot conduct a Beachhead Landing into a hex containing an enemy unit. A unit cannot conduct a Beachhead Landing into a hex in a Neutral Minor Country (). Beachhead Landings can be limited by Policies (), Truces (), and Failures (). Special SNLF Landing If the Axis faction has a supplied SNLF Beachhead-0 marker on the map, faction may conduct a Special SNLF Landing with that marker by taking a Japanese Detachment marker from the Axis Force Pool and placing marker in the Land hex adjacent to the SNLF Beachhead-0 marker's Beachhead Hexside. Special SNLF Landing Restrictions: An unsupplied SNLF Beachhead-0 cannot conduct a Special SNLF Landing . An SNLF Beachhead-0 cannot conduct a Special SNLF Landing into a hex containing an enemy unit. A Special SNLF Landing can be conducted into a hex containing an enemy Detachment or Logistics marker; place the enemy marker in the Delay Box. Clarification: Note that no ground unit is required to conduct a Special SNLF Landing that's because many of the initial Japanese landings in December 1941 were regiment-sized or smaller. Also keep in mind that SNLF Beachhead-0 markers are inherently Blitz-enabled. Airdrop Landing If an Airdrop marker is unsupplied or stacked with an enemy unit, place the Airdrop marker in the Delay Box. If an Airdrop marker is supplied and not stacked with an enemy unit, marker may conduct an Airdrop Landing. Clarification: If you can't or don't want to conduct an Airdrop Landing , simply place the Airdrop marker in the Delay Box . To conduct an Airdrop Landing, take a one-step infantry unit of the same nationality from unit Force Pool, place unit in the hex containing the Airdrop marker, and place the Airdrop marker in the Delay Box . The Western Airdrop marker can be replaced with either a British or US one-step infantry unit. Elite () infantry units cannot be placed in a hex in an Airdrop Landing. CV Strike Returns All CV Strike units in hexes are placed in that Naval Zone's Used Box. Regular Combat Segment For these rules, the phasing faction is the attacker, and the nonphasing faction the defender. A faction need not have a Blitz or Totsugeki marker on the map to attack in Totsugeki Regular Combat Segment. Attacks The phasing faction may declare an attack with defender ground units against one adjacent hex containing enemy ground units, Detachment markers, or Logistics markers. A complete Attack Sequence () for that attack must be resolved before another attack can be declared. In a Combat Segment, a faction may declare as many attacks as faction wishes and is eligible to perform, but the attacks are resolved one at a time. A hex can be attacked only once per Combat Segment , and all units in that hex must be involved in the combat. The defender cannot withhold units from that combat , nor can the attacker separately attack individual units within the hex . If defending units Retreat from one attack and end up in a hex that is the target of another attack in the same Combat Segment , units are included in the defense of that hex . A phasing ground unit can attack only once per Combat Segment . Phasing ground units do not have to be supplied to attack in a Combat Segment . Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 28 Phasing units in the same hex can attack different hexes. In addition, some units in the same hex can attack while others in that hex are withheld from attacking. Ground units in hexes with enemy or friendly Air units or Airdrop markers can attack and can be attacked. Attack Restrictions Attack Factor Restrictions: A phasing unit with an Attack Factor of 0 cannot attack. If the attacker cannot muster at least a raw 1-3 odds ratio (see Step 3 of but exclude any defending HQ providing Ranged Support and all Combat Shifts for this calculation), the attack cannot be made. Minor Country Restrictions: Units from different Minor Countries cannot attack the same hex. Exception: Exp units can attack with any other units of the same faction. Clarification: Not all of the Minor Country units have to be Exp units. For example, the Axis faction could have a Japanese unit, a regular Siamese unit, and a Hopeh Exp unit participate in an attack. The Axis faction could not then add a regular Hopeh unit to that attack however. Put another way, an attack may include any of that faction's Major Country units, any of one Minor Country's units, and finally any Exp units from other Minor Countries. A unit belonging to a Minor Country with a Free Passage (), Mobilizing (), or No Occupation () marker in hex Capital cannot attack a hex outside that Minor Country or one of hex Dependents. Terrain Restriction: Units cannot attack across All-Sea hexsides. Exceptions: Supplied marine units can attack across All-Sea hexsides (). Any unit can attack across an All-Sea hexside that is also a Beachhead Hexside. Other Restrictions: A unit cannot attack if Pre-War () is in effect. Combat can be limited by Policies (), Truces (), and Failures (). Clarification: Axis Kwantung units can attack a hex outside a Japanese Dependent. HQ Ranged Support A supplied HQ unit has the ability to participate in combat even if unit is not adjacent to the defending hex (when attacking) or in the defending hex (when defending). unit does this by providing Ranged Support . Design Note: Ranged Support represents the commitment of reserves, heavy equipment and local air assets to a battle. An HQ unit can provide Ranged Support to any combat that includes a ground unit of the same nationality as the HQ unit. Exceptions: A Soviet Communist Chinese HQ can provide Ranged Support to any Communist Chinese ground unit. A Western Nationalist Chinese HQ can provide Ranged Support to any Nationalist Chinese ground unit. Clarification: An HQ unit cannot provide Ranged Support to a friendly Detachment or Logistics marker alone in a hex. An HQ unit also cannot, by unit , use Ranged Support to attack a non-adjacent hex. An HQ unit providing Ranged Support includes unit Attack Factor (when attacking) or Defense Factor (when defending) to a combat within two hexes of unit current location. Ranged Support also applies a CRT column shift to that attack or defense. HQ Ranged Support Path: When providing Ranged Support a path is traced from the HQ unit's hex to the defending hex. Do not count the HQ unit's hex, but do count the defending hex. The path cannot be traced into a hex inside a Neutral Country or Policy Affected Country, or any Dependent belonging to a Neutral Country or Policy Affected Country . Clarification: Clarification can be traced through a hex containing an enemy unit or across an All-Sea hex. HQ Ranged Support Restrictions: An HQ unit that has participated in combat cannot provide Ranged Support to another combat later in the same Combat Segment. Clarification: This means you can soak off a defending HQ by attacking HQ hex, thereby preventing HQ from providing Ranged Support to another hex. One HQ unit per faction can participate in an individual combat. Clarification: So a defending HQ unit cannot provide Ranged Support to a defending hex that already includes an HQ unit. An HQ unit stacked on a Beachhead marker cannot provide Ranged Support except across that marker's Beachhead Hexside. Design Note: An HQ unit on a Beachhead is considered to be deeply engaged in defending and expanding Support perimeter, so Support can't throw Ranged Support elsewhere. Marine Assault A supplied marine unit may attack across any All-Sea hexside, even without being stacked on a Beachhead marker. Attack Sequence If the attack is declared against a hex that contains an enemy Detachment or Logistics marker and no enemy ground units, the attack automatically succeeds. The attacker may use Advance After Combat to enter the hex (). No Exploitation is possible (). Place the Detachment or Logistics marker in the Delay Box. If the attack is declared against a hex that contains an enemy ground unit, complete these steps in order: Step 1: The attacker chooses a hex containing an enemy ground unit and declares which adjacent phasing ground units will attack hex . If the attacking units do not already include an HQ unit, the attacker may declare one supplied HQ unit to provide Ranged Support. Step 2: If the defending hex does not have an HQ unit in unit , the defender may now declare one supplied HQ unit to provide Ranged Support . Step 3: Add up the Attack Factors of all attacking units (including an HQ unit providing Ranged Support ). This is the Attacker Total. Add up the Defense Factors of all defending units (including an HQ unit providing Ranged Support ). This is the Defender Total. Divide the Defender Total into the Attacker Total and express the result as one of the ratios found along the top of the Combat Results Table (CRT). Round any fractional results in favor of the defender. Odds greater than 9-1 or less than 1-3 are treated as 9-1 or 1-3 respectively. Example: If the Defender Total was 4 and the Attacker Total was 11, the odds ratio is 2-1 after rounding off in the defender's favor. If the attacker had one more Attack Factor, attacker would have 3-1 odds. Step 4: Determine the CRT column shifts () applicable to the attacker and defender . All shifts are cumulative add all attacker shifts and then subtract all defender shifts. Apply the net column shift to the column determined in Step 3. The result is the CRT column the combat will be resolved on in Step 5. Shifts above 9-1 or below 1-3 are resolved on the 9-1 or 1-3 columns, respectively. Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 29 Design Note: Never underestimate the importance of CRT column shifts. A 3-1 attack that receives three column shifts to the right would be resolved on the 9-1 column. Woo-hoo! Step 5: The attacker rolls one die and cross-indexes the result with the CRT column determined in Step 4. Note the Combat Result (), modifying it for Mud, Storms, or Snow when applicable. Step 6: Resolve any Retreats (). Step 7: Apply any Attrition () results, first to the attacking force, then to the defending force. Step 8: If the defending hex has been vacated, surviving attacking units may now Advance After Combat () or conduct Exploitation (). Clarification: Defending units cannot advance into a hex vacated by the attacker. CRT Column Shifts Air Unit (Air Force or CV Strike) The attacker receives a one-column shift to the right for each phasing Air unit (of the same nationality as at least one of the attacking units) in or adjacent to the defending hex. The defender receives a one-column shift to the left for each nonphasing Air unit (of the same nationality as at least one of the defending units) in or adjacent to the defending hex. An Air unit can provide a shift to any number of combats in the same Combat Segment. Exceptions: An Air unit cannot provide a shift if the defending hex is affected by Mud. An Air unit cannot provide a shift if the defending hex is affected by Storms or Snow, and the Air unit is adjacent to that hex . An Air unit does provide a shift if unit is in the defending hex unit . Clarification: An appropriate multi-national HQ (such as the Western CBI) providing ranged support may be sufficient to claim that a unit of the same nationality is one of the attacking or defending units, and thus eligible for an Air unit shift. Design Note: When placing Air units, remember units cannot be placed in the same hex or in hexes adjacent to one another. This often presents the attacker with a dilemma. To receive multiple Air Unit shifts against a single hex, multiple Air units need to be placed adjacent to the defender's hex (up to three can be placed around hex ). However, if an Air unit is placed in the defending hex unit , the enemy will not be able to place replacements, combine units, or move new ground units into that hex . In effect, an Air unit has interdicted that hex . The downside is that placing an Air unit directly on the defending hex means the attacker can only receive one Air unit CRT shift. Airdrop During the Blitz Combat Segment only, the attacker receives a onecolumn shift to the right for each Airdrop marker in the defending hex, regardless of nationality. Armor During the Blitz Combat Segment only, the attacker receives a onecolumn shift to the right if at least one of the attacking units is a supplied, Blitz-enabled armor-type unit. Clarification: That's one shift total, not one per armor unit. And only during Blitz Combat, not Regular Combat. Fortress The defender receives a one-column shift to the left if the defending hex contains a fortress unit. hex does not have to be supplied. HQ The attacker receives a one-column shift to the right if one of the attacking units is a supplied HQ unit (including one providing Ranged Support). The defender receives a one-column shift to the left if one of the defending units is a supplied HQ unit (including one providing Ranged Support ). Clarification: Note that a defending HQ unit does contribute unit defense factor (and HQ Shift) to any attack against unit hex, even if unit provided Ranged Support to another attack earlier in the same Combat Segment. This shift is in addition to the combat factors contributed to the combat. Marines If a supplied, Blitz-enabled marine unit attacks across a Beachhead, Strait or All-Sea hexside, the attacker receives a one-column shift to the right. Clarification: The defender still receives defender column shift for the terrain. So, if a marine unit attacked across an All-Sea hexside, the net shift would be one to the left. Mud The defender receives a one-column shift to the left if the defending hex is affected by Mud (). Clarification: Storms and Snow do not provide a column shift. Terrain The defender may receive one or more column shifts to the left based on the terrain in the defending hex and along the hexside(s) separating the adjacent attacking units from that hex . See the Terrain Effects Chart on the map to determine the shifts. Important: A hexside shift is in addition to those for hex terrain. However, only one hexside shift is applicable, and shift must be the lowest hexside shift out of all the different hexside terrain types being attacked across. Example: A defender in a clear hex being attacked from across a river hexside in one direction, and a mountain hexside in another, receives only one shift to the left. If the defender was in a City instead of a clear hex, City would receive two shifts to the left one for the City and one for the river. Combat Results There are two types of results on the Combat Results Table, a Retreat result and an Attrition result. Retreat results are always applied before Attrition results. Clarification: Retreat results are italicized on the CRT, to remind you to perform results first. Important: Only units involved in a specific combat are affected by combat results. Clarification: So if a unit in a hex was left out of an attack, combat just sits there. combat does not suffer an attacker step loss, Retreat, Advance After Combat, or anything else. Retreat Results Apply these before Attrition Results. See on how to satisfy a Retreat result. All attacking ground units must Retreat one hex, or one of the attacking units must take a step loss (). If Retreat is possible, the attacker chooses which to do. Clarification: Yes, only one of the attacking units takes the loss . Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 30 Ex Exchange. All attacking ground units must Retreat one hex, or one of the attacking ground units must take a step loss (). If Retreat is possible, the attacker chooses which to do. If the attacker Retreats, the defender does nothing. If the attacker takes the step loss, then all ground units in the defending hex must Retreat one hex, or one of the defending ground units must take a step loss. If Retreat is possible, the defender chooses which to do. All ground units in the defending hex must Retreat the indicated number of hexes. If Retreat is not (or is no longer) possible, the remaining unsatisfied Retreat result is converted into step losses on a one-for-one basis until either the full Retreat result is satisfied or Retreat becomes possible again (). Weather Effects on Combat: Reduce the Dr result against a defending hex affected by Mud, Storms, or Snow as follows: Dr3 becomes Dr2 Dr2 becomes Dr1 Dr1 becomes Ex Ex, Ad, and Attrition results are not affected by Mud , Storms , or Snow . Attrition Result Apply these after Retreat Results. See on how to satisfy an Attrition result. The number to the left of the slash is the number of step losses taken by the attacker and is applied first. The number to the right of the slash is the number of step losses taken by the defender. Retreat The owning faction takes the Retreating unit or stack and places unit in any adjacent Land hex or All-Sea hex containing a friendly Beachhead marker, as limited by Retreat Requirements below. If necessary, the owning faction then does this again (from the current hex) until the Retreat result is fully satisfied. Retreat is not considered movement, so ignore a unit's MA, MP costs, or movement restrictions. Retreat has Retreat own restrictions below (). A force Retreats one hex at a time. Retreat Priorities and Retreat Restrictions are checked each time before the force Retreats from force current hex. Clarification: So you don't look at every possible Retreat path all at once. Just do force one hex at a time. Defending stacked units must Retreat together into the same hex. Attacking stacked units that participated in the combat must also Retreat together into the same hex. Attacking units located in different hexes do not have to Retreat into the same hex, but the individual stacks must remain together. Clarification: Non-attacking units in a stack that suffers an Ad result do not Retreat. Important: If a force Retreats into a hex containing other ground units, all ground units in that hex are now part of the Retreating stack and must be included in any remaining Retreats and Attrition results that have yet to be fulfilled. Clarification: In other words, Clarification 's a rout! Note that just ground units are caught up in the rout , not friendly support units or markers like Detachments. In addition, units joining a Retreat stack in this fashion are considered to have been involved in that original combat. Example: A unit Retreats into a hex containing an HQ unit. That HQ is now part of the Retreating force and is considered to have participated in the combat . That means the HQ cannot provide Ranged Support to another combat later in the same Combat Segment. Doh! Units can Retreat out of a hex containing an enemy Air unit or Airdrop marker. Mud, Storms, or Snow do not affect the Retreat procedure. Clarification: Bad weather may have affected the Retreat Result, but Result won't affect how to apply weather . Retreat Priorities The owning faction must Retreat faction units into a hex that meets the following priorities, which are checked in order: Priority 1: The hex to be Retreated into must be farther away from the defending hex than any previous hex Retreated into, and hex cannot contain an EZOC. Priority 2: If no hex exists that meets Priority 1, then the Retreat must enter a hex that is farther away from the defending hex than any previous hex Retreated into, and hex must contain a friendly ground, Airdrop, or Air unit. If no hex exists that meets Priority 1 or 2, the force cannot Retreat. If within a specific Priority there is more than one hex available to Retreat into, the owning faction chooses the hex . Clarification: You may not double back or retreat into a hex that is not further away from the defending hex, even if an EZOC does not extend into the hex . Terrain features, such as All-Sea or Mountain hexsides, and enemy units do not affect the requirement that each hex of the Retreat be farther away. Example: The Japanese 15th Army in w4520 attacks the Nationalist Chinese HQ unit in Chungking (w4620) and gets an Ad result. Army cannot retreat into the hexes labeled No. Although there is no EZOC in those hexes (because of the mountain hexsides), those hexes are not further away from Chungking than w4520 is. Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 31 Example: The British unit in Akyab (w4114) must fulfill a Dr3 result. If Dr3 Retreated first to w4214 and then to Dacca (w4313), Dr3 cannot then Retreat to Calcutta (w4213) or w4314. Despite the All-Sea hexside, Calcutta is only two hexes away from Akyab , the same distance as Dacca . The unit would instead have to retreat to w4312, w4413, or w Retreat Restrictions A force cannot Retreat if force includes a unit with a Movement Allowance of 0, and that unit participated in the combat. A force cannot Retreat if force includes an HQ unit (including one providing Ranged Support) that participated in the combat . A unit cannot Retreat into an Off-Map Box. A unit cannot Retreat into a hex containing an enemy unit, Airdrop marker, or Beachhead marker. Clarification: Clarification can Retreat into a hex with an enemy Detachment or Logistics marker, or a friendly Airdrop or Beachhead marker. A unit cannot Retreat across an All-Sea hexside unless it is a Strait or Beachhead Hexside (i. the hexside that the Beachhead marker's arrow points to). Example: A unit in Taihoku (w4324) can Retreat into Foochow (w4424) but not into Amoy (w4323). A unit cannot Retreat into a hex belonging to a Neutral Minor Country () or Policy Affected Country (). Retreat Conversion Mandatory Retreat Conversion: If a Retreating force cannot (or can no longer) Retreat without violating both Retreat Priorities or any of the Retreat Restrictions listed above, that force stops Retreating. The owning faction must now convert the remaining unsatisfied Retreat result into step losses on a one-for-one basis until either the full Retreat result is satisfied or Retreat becomes possible again. Retreat Retreats two hexes into a hex with an HQ unit, which now becomes part of the Retreating force. Since a force with an HQ cannot Retreat, force must convert the last unsatisfied Retreat result into a step loss. Design Note: You can do a lot of damage by forcing enemy units to Retreat back onto units HQ units, or by herding enemy units into an overstacked situation. Retreating units may violate Stacking Limits during and at the end of units Retreat, but such stacks will have to conform to units when that Combat Segment is over. A force must continue Retreating again if whatever condition temporarily prevented force Retreat no longer applies, until the Retreat result is fully satisfied. Example: The Western defending force includes the Kiangsu 9th War Zone and KMT HQ unit providing Ranged Support. The Western faction must take a step loss. faction chooses the HQ, breaking HQ down and replacing HQ with a one-step infantry unit. Since the Retreating force no longer has an HQ unit, the 9th War Zone must Retreat and fulfill the other two results. Zone could retreat into w4723 or into w4623. Note that the one-step Kiangsu Res infantry unit located in w4623 (where the HQ was) would not initially be considered part of the Retreating stack, so part would not have to Retreat unless the 9th War Zone chose to retreat into that hex. At that point, part would join the stack as the Retreat continues into w4722 or w4522. The lake hexside prevents a retreat into w4622. Voluntary Retreat Conversion: A defending force may convert Retreat results into step losses on a one-for-one basis if either or both of the following situations applies: All adjacent attacking ground units are attacking across Strait, Beachhead, or Mountain hexsides. The defending hex contains a City and does not contain a Blitz or Totsugeki marker. Important: Defending units Retreating through Cities or across Strait , Beachhead , or Mountain hexsides do not receive this Voluntary Retreat Conversion option. Design Note: While defenders could turn an urban center like Stalingrad into a fortress, if Stalingrad was on the verge of capture defenders would be just as likely to declare Stalingrad an open city and abandon Stalingrad to protect the historic landmarks and civilians within. A historical example of this is Manila in Attrition A faction satisfies Attrition results by eliminating steps from any of faction ground units involved in that combat (including an HQ unit providing Ranged Support). To do so, the faction declares which unit will suffer a step loss and reduces faction step value by one. The faction continues to eliminate steps in this fashion until the Attrition result is fully satisfied or all of result units that took part in that combat are eliminated. Unless stated otherwise, the owning faction chooses which unit or units will lose the steps. Clarification: So the step losses from an Attrition result can be spread among different units. But be sure to pay particular attention to the Attacker Losses rule below. Attacker Losses Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 32 If an attacking force suffers losses in a combat (either through Attrition or an Ad or Ex result), it may be required to eliminate certain steps as Ex first loss in a combat: If an attacking force includes a marine unit attacking across an All-Sea, Beachhead, or Strait Hexside, the first step loss that force suffers must be a marine step. If an attacking force includes an armor-type unit, the first step loss that force suffers must be an armor-type step from an armortype unit. If both conditions apply, the attacker must choose between a marine or armor-type step to fulfill step first step loss. After fulfilling any required first step loss, the owning faction may assign faction remaining combat step losses as faction wishes. Clarification: If you have marine and armor units in an attack, the first loss must come from either unit, but after that you can assign the losses as you wish. You do not have to eliminate the other unit as your next loss. Example: An attacking US force on a Beachhead consisting of a 7 2 three-step mech unit and a 41 two-step infantry army suffers an Beachhead 1/0 result. Because the force is on a Beachhead force cannot Retreat. So the Ad result must be converted to a step loss, which must be an armor step, which reduces the 72 mech to a 41 infantry unit. The required Attrition loss may be taken from either remaining unit. Eliminating Steps When a unit is removed from unit location due to the elimination of one or more steps, it is placed in the Delay Box if unit has a Delay Stripe. Otherwise, place unit in unit Force Pool. Exception: The Japanese IG HQ is removed from the game when eliminated. Eliminating One-Step Units: To eliminate a one-step unit, remove unit from unit location. Eliminating Steps from Two-Step Units: To eliminate a step from a two-step unit with a one-step unit on unit other side, simply flip the unit over to unit one-step side. To eliminate a step from a two-step unit without a one-step unit on faction other side, the owning faction takes a one-step unit from the Force Pool that could have been used to combine the two-step unit. Pool places faction where the two-step unit is and removes the two-step unit from faction location. Clarification: This applies to a two-step unit that has a three-step unit on faction other side, or nothing at all either way faction does not have a onestep unit on faction other side. Eliminating Steps from Three-Step Units: To eliminate a step from a three-step unit, simply flip the unit over to unit two-step side. Example: A US 72 three-step mech unit loses a step. The unit is flipped over to unit 41 two-step side. Whether attacking or defending, that just cost an armor step. Holding Box units: A multi-step unit that has a Holding Box in Box Force Pool is reduced in steps using the above procedure and the corresponding units in Box Holding Box . Example: The Western two-step ABDA multi-national infantry army suffers one step loss while defending in combat. The Western ABDA Holding Box contains a Netherlands East Indies infantry unit. The Western faction can choose to eliminate the NEI unit in the Holding Box and leave the British FE infantry unit in the hex. Or unit can eliminate the British FE infantry unit and take the NEI unit from the Holding Box and place unit in the hex . Eliminating Steps Restrictions: Elite units () cannot be taken from a Force Pool and placed in a hex or Off-Map Box unless that unit was necessary to combine into that multi-step unit. A player cannot switch different multi-step units in the process of eliminating steps. Advance After Combat After all results of a combat have been satisfied by both sides, if the defending hex does not contain an enemy unit or Beachhead marker, then a supplied ground unit of the attacking force can Advance After Combat . To do so, the attacker takes the unit and places unit in the defending hex. Advance After Combat is not considered movement, so ignore a unit's MA, MP costs, or movement restrictions. Advance After Combat has Advance own restrictions below. Any number of the attacking supplied ground units can Advance After Combat . Advance After Combat is conducted one unit at a time, and can continue as long as there are units eligible to perform one. Clarification: Watch out for stacking limits! You can exceed limits , but someone will die if you re still overstacked at the end of the Combat Segment. A unit can Advance After Combat out of a hex containing an Enemy Zone of Control or an enemy Air unit. A unit can Advanced After Combat into a hex containing any enemy marker except a Beachhead. Advance After Combat is not affected by Mud, Storms, or Snow. Advance After Combat Restrictions: A unit with a Movement Allowance of 0 cannot Advance After Combat. A unit cannot Advance After Combat into a hex it would be prohibited from entering during a Movement Phase (). Clarification: An Axis Kwantung unit typically cannot Advance After Combat or Exploit into a hex outside a Japanese Dependent, because unit cannot move into such hexes unless Russia, Communist China and Nationalist China are all not Policy Affected Countries. An HQ unit cannot Advance After Combat. The presence of an HQ unit in an attacking force does not prevent the non-HQ units from advancing. A unit that is not adjacent to the defending hex cannot Advance After Combat. Clarification: This restriction prohibits the remnants of an HQ providing Ranged Support to the attack from Advancing After Combat . Exploitation If a supplied ground unit is eligible to conduct an Advance After Combat (but before unit conducts one), and the attacking force included an armor-type unit (even if unit did not survive the combat), unit may conduct Exploitation instead of Advance After Combat . To do so, the attacker takes the unit and places unit in the defending hex. Then, attacker takes the unit (from the current hex) and places unit in any adjacent Land hex. The attacker may continue to do this again until the unit has gone unit full Exploitation Distance. A unit is not required to go unit full Exploitation Distance. Exploitation is not considered movement, so ignore a unit's MP costs or movement restrictions. Exploitation has Exploitation own restrictions below. Any number of the attacking supplied ground units can conduct Exploitation . Exploitation is conducted one unit at a time and can continue as long as there are units eligible to perform time . All attacking units in a stack Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 33 do not have to conduct Exploitation into the same hex beyond the initial defending hex. An Exploiting unit must stop if unit is placed in a hex containing an EZOC unless another friendly unit is in that hex , in which case unit can continue. An Exploiting unit must stop if unit is placed in a hex across an All-Sea, Beachhead, Mountain, or Strait Hexside. Design Note: Difficult terrain and combat fatigue limit pursuit. A unit can conduct Exploitation out of a hex containing an enemy Air unit. Exploitation is not affected by Storms or Snow. Exploitation Distance: The total number of hexes an Exploiting unit can enter is equal to: The number of hexes the defending force actually Retreated (i. the number of different hexes force was placed in), plus The number of Retreat and/or Attrition results the defender did not satisfy in some fashion. The defending hex does count as one of the Exploitation hexes. Example: A Russian one-step ground unit suffers a Dr3 0/1 result. unit Retreats three hexes and then is eliminated. The Exploitation Distance is 3. The attacking force can be placed in up to three hexes that is, the defending hex and two other hexes. A Russian infantry unit in Chita (w5824) suffers a Dr1 0/1 result. The Soviet faction performs an Optional Retreat Conversion () and converts the Dr1 result to a step loss, satisfying that result and eliminating the unit . The Exploitation Distance is 1 because one Attrition result is unsatisfied. In this case, Exploitation is no different than Advance After Combat. Exploitation Restrictions: A unit with a Movement Allowance of 0 cannot conduct Exploitation. A unit cannot conduct Exploitation into a hex affected by Mud. The Exploitation Distance for a unit cannot exceed Distance Movement Allowance. If Distance does exceed, reduce the Exploitation Distance (for that unit only) to match the unit's MA. Design Note: This restriction is very important. Because of the reduced MAs in DS (compared to TK), most units will not be able to Exploit, and even those that can Exploit will only get to go two hexes before stopping. A unit cannot conduct Exploitation into a hex unit would be prohibited from entering during a Movement Phase (). A unit cannot conduct Exploitation into a hex containing an enemy unit. A unit belonging to a Minor Country with a Free Passage (), Mobilizing (), or No Occupation () marker in Exploitation Capital cannot conduct Exploitation into a hex outside that Minor Country or one of Exploitation Dependents. A unit cannot conduct Exploitation into an Off-Map Box. Exploitation can be limited by Policies (), Truces (), and Failures (). Marker Segment In this Segment, the phasing faction adjusts some markers on the map before conducting faction Reserve Movement Phase. Perform these steps in order: Step 1: If the phasing faction has a Troop Convoy marker in a Naval Zone's Used Box, faction may move that marker back to the Naval Zone's Convoys Box. Clarification: This will allow you to use the marker for transport during the upcoming Reserve Movement Phase. Step 2: If the phasing faction has a Blitz, Totsugeki, Failure, or Mobilizing marker on the map, marker must remove the marker and set faction aside for future use. Step 3: If the Axis faction has an SNLF Beachhead-0 marker on the map , faction must remove the marker and set marker aside for future use. After all such markers have been removed, Axis ground units in an All-Sea hex without a friendly Beachhead marker are eliminated. Eliminated units that have a Delay Stripe are placed in the Delay Box; all others are returned to others Force Pool. Reserve Movement Phase Movement in this Phase follows the same as in the Operational Movement Phase, with the following modifications: An unsupplied unit can move. A unit cannot move into or out of a hex containing an EZOC. An armor unit cannot conduct an overrun. Important: Any unit that moves along a Road or Rail hex in an active enemy Major or Minor Country must pay 1 MP per hex entered. Clarification: Reserves must move cautiously through unsecured enemy territory. One-step units can continue to move at the MP per hex rate through friendly Countries, Conquered Countries, and Dependents. Design Note: The Reserve Movement Phase is the right time to think ahead to your next Organization Segment and move ground units you want to combine into the same location. Final Administrative Phase In this Phase, the phasing faction performs some final tasks before ending faction Faction Turn. War & Peace Segment The phasing faction performs the following in the order listed: Step 1: faction may declare war on Neutral Minor Countries. Step 2: faction may reduce the level of Truce markers. Declare War The phasing faction may select a Neutral Minor Country and activate Country . If an Allied faction made the selection, it is activated as an Axis Country. If the Axis faction made the selection , it is activated as an Allied Country see to determine the Minor Country 's alignment. Clarification: Note this activation may end a Policy (). If a country is activated as an Axis Country during the War & Peace Segment, the Axis faction may place a No Occupation marker () in faction capital. After the Minor Country is set up (), the phasing faction may declare war on another Neutral Minor Country. Country may continue in this fashion until Country no longer wishes to do so. Clarification: The Axis faction does not declare war against Britain, Russia, the US, or any active Allied Minor Country. Similarly, Allied factions do not declare war on Japan or any active Axis Minor Country. Declare War Restrictions: If Pre-War is in effect, a faction cannot declare war in war War & Peace Segment. Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 34 If Limited War is in effect, an Allied faction cannot declare war during war War & Peace Segments. Clarification: Remember, during Total War the Western faction can't declare war on a country at the end of war Faction Turn and have Soviet units move into war in units upcoming Faction Turn (). Reduce Truce Markers The Posture Display may contain Truce markers that affect the Allied factions. These Truce markers may be adjusted during play. In the War & Peace Segment of a Seasonal Turn, the phasing faction may reduce all Truce markers affecting an Allied faction by one level. In the War & Peace Segment of a Non-seasonal Turn, the faction player may reduce all Negotiation markers (only) affecting an Allied faction. Example: Example is a Non-seasonal Turn and there is an Armistice marker in Russia's Posture Box, and a Negotiation marker in the British and US Posture Boxes. Because faction is a Non-seasonal Turn, the Axis faction cannot reduce the Armistice marker affecting Russia. If the Axis player chooses to reduce the Negotiation markers, player must reduce markers both player is not allowed to reduce Britain's but leave the US alone. The Soviet or Western faction can reduce Truce markers affecting markers respective faction only. The Axis player may reduce markers affecting either or both Allied factions. Clarification: Note that the non-phasing faction has no control over these reductions. A Truce marker level is reduced as follows: Remove a Reassess Policy marker and place an Armistice marker in the same Posture Box. Flip an Armistice marker to marker Negotiation side. Clarification: Reassess Policy and Armistice Truce markers have red borders to remind you borders can only be reduced on Seasonal Turns. Also, all three Truce markers have a red, yellow, or green stoplight icon to show how close you are to fighting again. Conditional Events Segment The phasing faction performs the following in the order listed: Step 1: faction must check each of faction Permanent Conditional Events (, , ) in the order Events are listed. Only the phasing faction's Permanent Conditional Events are checked. Clarification: You do not check Axis Permanent Conditional Events during the Western or Soviet Turns. Step 2: Step must check any events listed under Conditional Events Segment on Step Current Card. Important: Unless otherwise restricted or not possible, if a Conditional Event's conditions are fulfilled, that event must be implemented. The results of one event must be implemented before the next event is checked. If an event calls for a roll on a Political Event Table, do not apply any Political DRMs unless specifically stated otherwise. Conditional Replacements: These are received in each Conditional Event Segment, provided These conditions on the Current Card are fulfilled. These are placed per Placing Replacements () Clarification: So, unlike Seasonal Replacements, you can receive Conditional Replacements each Turn of a Season. Eliminating Steps: If the elimination of steps is required, see . AE Conditional Events: Each faction must perform all Conditional Event checks on the TK map before performing checks on the DS map. The effects of a Conditional Event apply only on faction map unless specifically stated otherwise. Example: When the Soviet faction performs Emergency Mobilization in TK, the Axis faction cannot apply the free Influence event faction receives to a Minor Country on the DS map. End of Game Turn Phase The following occurs once per Game Turn after all factions have taken factions respective Faction Turns. Delay Segment A Delay Result is determined for each counter in the Delay Box and Naval Warfare Delay Box. The Delay Result is how many turns Result will take for that counter to return to play. A Delay Result less than 1 is treated as 1. There is no upper limit on a Delay Result. To determine a Delay Result, select one counter from a Delay Box, roll one die, and apply the appropriate Delay DRMs based on the counter's faction. Delay DRMs are listed on the map. The modified result is that counter's Delay Result. Example: A Delay die roll is being made for a Russian unit. Only the Soviet Delay DRMs are applied to the roll, not ones listed under Axis or Western. You can use the DRM markers provided as a reminder of each faction's current Delay DRM. Once a Delay Result has been determined, the counter is placed on the Turn Track that many number of Turn Boxes ahead of the current Turn Box. Do not count the current Turn Box . When you are placing a counter on the Turn Track that could be considered either a unit or a marker (such as a paratroop unit/Airdrop marker), place the piece so that piece unit side is face-up. Clarification: A counter can be placed in a Turn Box that is past the Turn Box containing the V-J Day marker. Example: Example is the Delay Segment of the Sept-Oct 1943 Game Turn. A Japanese Air unit in the Delay Box is selected and a die roll is made. Per the Axis Delay DRMs List, the die roll is modified as follows: The current USCL is 1, which provides a +1 DRM. Total War is in effect and the Rising Sun VP marker is in the 1 VP Box, so that's -1. The Axis War Production marker in the Strategic Warfare Box, so that's another -1. The modified result is 3 (4+11), so the Japanese Air unit's Delay Result is 3. The Air Force unit is placed three Turns ahead on the Turn Track, in the Mar-Apr 1944 Box. Units leaving a Delay Box must be placed in a Turn Box on the same map. Clarification: In other words, units in a TK Delay Box stay on the TK map units can't be placed on the DS map. Naval Warfare Delay Box: When determining the Delay Result for a counter in the Naval Warfare Delay Box , if the unmodified die roll is 6, roll again and add the two die rolls together. Then apply the appropriate the Delay DRMs. The modified result is that counter's Delay Result. Example: result is the Delay Segment of the Mar-Apr 1944 game turn. A British Surf Fleet unit in the Naval Warfare Delay Box is selected and a die roll is made. So the Western faction rolls again, this time getting a 5. Both results are added to get 11 (6 + 5). The cumulative Western Delay DRM is 3, so the Fleet unit's Delay Result is 8. Ouch! Design Note: This deep six result represents the sinking of a large number of ships, which take longer to replace. A historical example would be the loss of four Japanese carriers at Midway in 1942. Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 35 Axis Convoy Strategy Marker: If the Axis Convoy Strategy marker is in the Strategic Warfare Box, the Axis faction may perform one Delay Reduction () after determining faction Delay Results. Turn Marker Segment The Turn Marker is moved to the next box on the Turn Track. Clarification: The Turn Marker is double-sided, with an Axis side and an Allied side. You can flip the Marker over after the end of the Axis and Soviet Faction Turns to remind you of whose Faction Turn Soviet is. If the Turn Marker is in the bottom-right corner box (i. Nov-Dec 1942 or 1948), move the Marker to the upper-left corner box (i. JanFeb 1937 or 1943) and continue the game. Clarification: To save space, the Turn Track repeats Track . That is, the 1937 row of boxes is also used for 1943, 1940 stands in for 1944, and so on. If your game continues past 1948, go ahead and keep playing just remember the year is really 1949! All counters in the box entered by the Turn Marker are removed and placed as follows: Step 1: Ground units, support units, Convoy markers, Detachment markers, Logistics markers, and Partisan Base markers are placed in units and units and markers and markers and markers and markers faction's DS Force Pool. Step 2: Other markers are placed per units and units and markers and markers and markers and markers own rules. Zone of Control (ZOC) A ground unit projects a Zone of Control (ZOC ) into every hex adjacent to the hex unit currently occupies. Exceptions: A ZOC is not projected into a hex across a Mountain Hexside. A ZOC is not projected into a hex across an All-Sea or Strait hexside, except across a Beachhead Hexside. Clarification: If the All-Sea hex contains a Beachhead marker, but the hexside is not the marker's Beachhead Hexside , then there is no ZOC . A ZOC is not projected into a hex within a Policy Affected Country (). A ground unit belonging to a Policy Affected Country does not project a ZOC . Enemy ZOC (EZOC) A EZOC projected by an enemy unit is referred to as an Enemy Zone of Control (EZOC ). Clarification: Remember all non-phasing units are enemy units. In some cases (as specified below and elsewhere), the presence of a friendly unit or Airdrop marker in a hex negates the effects of all EZOC projected in that hex . Clarification: Logistics, Partisan Base, and Detachment markers do not negate EZOC . If a friendly unit negates EZOC , EZOC does so immediately and for as long as EZOC is in the hex . Example: In the Operational Movement Phase, a ground unit move into a hex with an EZOC and stops moving. This negates the EZOC for any other friendly unit moving into that hex . EZOC Effects Operational Movement Phase: If a unit does not start a Movement Phase in an EZOC, unit must stop moving when unit moves into a hex containing an EZOC. Exception: A unit does not have to stop if another friendly unit is in that EZOC hex, or the moving unit is conducting an Overrun against the unit projecting the EZOC . If a unit starts a Movement Phase in an EZOC, unit can move out of that hex . It is allowed to move directly into another EZOC hex, in which case unit may have to stop per the above. Mud: A unit cannot move out of an EZOC hex affected by Mud . Storms, Snow: A unit must stop moving after unit moves into or out of an EZOC hex affected by Storms or Snow . Reserve Movement Phase: Units cannot move into or out of an EZOC hex. Supply: A supply line cannot be traced into an EZOC hex, unless another friendly unit is in the hex . Retreat: A unit cannot Retreat into a hex containing an EZOC, unless another friendly unit is in that hex . Clarification: But remember to follow Retreat Requirements (). You must retreat into a hex without an EZOC if possible. Exploitation: A unit that is conducting Exploitation must stop if unit enters an EZOC hex, unless another friendly unit is in that hex . Example: The British Ind colonial infantry unit in Imphal (w4415) exerts a ZOC into all hexes labeled Z. Z. does not exert a ZOC into the hex labeled X because of the mountain hexside between w4415 and w4416. Z. exerts a ZOC into the hex labeled Y, but the Japanese infantry unit there negates that EZOC for Operational Movement. That means the Japanese tank unit in Mandalay (w4215) could move to Ledo (w4515) without having to stop in w4315 or w. Stacking Two or more counters in the same hex are called a stack. Placing more than one friendly unit in the same hex is called stacking. Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 36 Stacking restrictions and limits apply only to hexes. Any number or combination of friendly ground units can exist together in an Off-Map Box. Stacking Restrictions An HQ unit cannot stack with another HQ. A Fortress unit cannot stack with another Fortress. Ground units of different Minor Countries cannot stack together. Exceptions: One-step Exp units can stack with any other units of the same faction. A Nationalist Chinese HQ unit can stack with any Western Chinese unit. A Communist Chinese HQ can stack with any Soviet Chinese unit. Clarification: Similar to the rule regarding attacks made with Minor Country units, a stack may include any of that faction's Major Country units, any of one Minor Country's units, and finally any Exp units from other Minor Countries. Stacking Limits Only friendly ground units in a hex count toward stacking limits. All other counters in that hex do not count. If a hex or Beachhead marker contains a Limited Stacking symbol (see Terrain Key) in Key , up to three ground units with a total of three steps between hex and marker can be stacked in that hex . In all other hexes, up to three ground units with a total of six steps between hex and marker can be stacked in the same hex. Any stack in excess of three ground units or that hex's allowable number of steps is overstacked. Stacking Violations Important: Stacking Restrictions and Limits are enforced for all factions and all hexes at the end of every Phase and Segment. If a hex is overstacked or contains units that violate Stacking Restrictions, the owning faction must eliminate sufficient steps () to bring that hex into compliance with Stacking Restrictions and Limits . Stacking Restrictions and Limits apply only to hexes. Any number or combination of friendly ground units can exist together in an Off-Map Box. Clarification: You are free to violate stacking limits during any Phase or Segment, but you will pay the penalty at the end. In some cases, especially during Retreats, you may have no option but to violate stacking limits. Stacking limits occasionally force you to plan ahead too. For example, say the Western player is trying to liberate a Conquered Country () with some Minor Country non-Exp units. player may be better off not using Advance After Combat into the liberated Country or Capital, because if player does so, player won't be able to receive the Minor Capital 's 01 Res infantry unit in the hex when the Minor Capital reactivates during the Conditional Events Segment without eliminating those other units. Design Note: About stacking limits and Beachhead markers: you may notice that a Beachhead can have a stacking limit of six steps, even when it's being used to attack an island like Iwo Jima with a stacking limit of three steps. That might seem odd, but in World War II, the determined amphibious attacker generally had the advantage most of these assaults succeeded. The Beachhead 's extra stacking limit represents the attacker's logistical support committed to make the invasion succeed. Supply A unit or markers must be able to trace a supply line in order to conduct various game mechanics, as listed in mechanics respective rules. A unit or marker that can trace a supply line to a supply source is considered supplied. If line cannot, it is considered unsupplied. Supply Sources The following are supply sources: A Home Country City is a supply source for any counter belonging to that Country. A Partisan Base marker is a supply source for any counter belonging to the Minor Country in which source is located. Example: A Partisan Base marker in Hopeh would be a supply source for only Hopeh units. A Western Off-Map Box is a supply source for any Western counter. A Soviet Off-Map Box is a supply source for any Soviet counter. Supply Sources Restriction: A City or Partisan Base cannot be used as a supply source if source hex contains an enemy unit, Airdrop, Detachment, or Logistics marker. Supply Line A supply line is traced from the hex containing the counter to a supply source. Do not count the hex containing the counter . A supply line can be traced out of a hex containing an enemy unit or marker. Clarification: If the unit occupies a hex or Off-Map Box containing a supply source, it is supplied no need to trace a supply line. A supply line is traced for each unit or marker at the moment supply is needed. Clarification: When a ground unit is selected to move in the Operational Movement Phase, a check is made to see if a supply line can be traced for check . If one cannot be traced, that unit cannot move at that particular moment. If at a later time in that same Movement Phase a supply line can be traced, the unit could move then. Two Hex Free Trace: Up to the first two hexes of a supply line can be traced through any hex that is not otherwise prohibited by Supply Line Restrictions below. Clarification: Only the very first two hexes of a supply line can be traced across any kind of terrain. Once you start to trace supply via a Rail/Road network (see below), you can't leave that network for a hex or two and still trace supply. Road/Rail Trace: If a supply line reaches a hex (of the owning faction's choice) containing a Road or Rail symbol, it can then be traced any distance along a series of connected Road/Rail symbols to a supply source. If Road or Rail symbols adjoin a Connected Strait, symbols are considered connected. However, the Supply Line can only be traced across one Connected Strait or stretch of contiguous Road hexes. Once a Supply Line crosses a Connected Strait or Road hex, it cannot later be traced across a second Connected Strait , or a Road hex separated by Rail hexes from the original Road hex. Example: A Japanese unit in Calcutta (w4213) could not use the combination of Road and Rail hexes to trace overland supply back to Saigon, as any path Saigon could trace would involve two separate stretches of Road hexes, the first being the stretch between Imphal/Mandalay or Ledo/Myitkyina, the second being the stretch between Moulmein and Bangkok. Naval Zone Trace: A supply line can be traced across a Naval Zone from an Open Port to Open Port within that Naval Zone. line can continue through any number of Naval Zones in this fashion. Each Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 37 Naval Zone along the supply line must contain a friendly Supply Convoy marker in marker Convoys Box. Note that several Naval Zones have inherent Axis or Western Supply Convoy markers. Supply Line Combinations: A supply line can be traced any distance along any combination of connected Rail hexes, one stretch of contiguous Road hexes or Connected Strait, across Naval Zones and/or between Off-Map Boxes. Example: A British ground unit is in hex w3916. Because a Japanese Detachment marker is in Rangoon, the Western faction traces faction first hex of unit's supply line into Chiengmai (w4016). The second hex is traced into w4115, which contains a Rail symbol. From there, the line is traced along connected Road and Rail hexes to Dacca, a British Open Port. From there, the Western faction traces supply across the Bay of Bengal and West Indian Ocean Naval Zones to the Europe/Africa Box, a Western Supply Source. The Japanese Detachment in Rangoon traces supply across the Bay of Bengal , South China Sea and Yellow Sea Naval Zones (all of which contain Axis Supply Convoy markers) to Nagasaki, a Japanese Home Country Open Port and supply source. A US Sub Fleet is in the South China Sea Naval Zone Box. Since all Ports in a Naval Zone containing an enemy Fleet unit cannot be Open Ports, the Axis faction cannot trace a supply line across the South China Sea Naval Zone. Overland Supply: If a rule specifically states a unit or marker must trace an overland supply line, then no part of that supply line can be traced across a Naval Zone . Eastern Europe Box: For purposes of tracing a supply line, hexes w5311 to w6011 along the western map edge are considered part of the Eastern Europe Box . A supply line traced into one of those hexes is considered to have been traced to the Eastern Europe Box . Supply Line Restrictions: A supply line cannot be traced into an EZOC hex unless another friendly unit is in that hex . A supply line cannot be traced into a hex containing any enemy unit, Airdrop, Detachment, or Logistics marker. A supply line cannot be traced into a hex that contains an enemy Partisan Base marker and does not contain a friendly ground unit. A supply line cannot be traced into a hex containing a City and/or Port in an enemy Country (excluding Conquered Allied Countries) unless line is under friendly control. A supply line cannot be traced into a hex in a Neutral Minor Country (). An Allied unit or marker with a Posture of War cannot trace a supply line into a PAC hex () or use a PAC Supply Convoy. A supply line cannot be traced across an All-Sea hexside unless the hexside is a Strait hexside or is part of a hex containing a Beachhead marker. Clarification: Note that you can trace supply through any hexside of a hex containing a Beachhead marker, not just the Beachhead Hexside. Supply Effects An HQ unit must be supplied and in unit Home Country to be a Replacement Location (). An Axis or Western Logistics marker must be able to trace a supply line to be a Replacement Location. A Soviet Logistics marker must be able to trace an overland supply line to be a Replacement Location. A ground unit, Detachment marker, or Logistics marker must be supplied to serve as an Air Base or Naval Base in the Support Segment. Units must be supplied to combine during the Organization Segment (). Clarification: Unsupplied units can convert into a fortress or break down. Only phasing supplied ground units can move in the Operational Movement Phase (). Clarification: Unsupplied units can move during the Reserve Movement Phase (5). An Airborne unit must be supplied to conduct an Airdrop () in the Blitz Combat Segment. An attacking armor unit must be supplied to provide an Armor Shift in the Blitz Combat Segment (). An Airdrop marker must be able to trace a supply line to be replaced by a one-step infantry unit in the Airdrop Landing part of the Blitz Combat Segment (). An HQ unit must be supplied to provide Ranged Support () and/or an HQ Shift (). A marine unit must be supplied to reduce the number of shifts a defender receives for a Beachhead or Straits Hexside (). A unit must be supplied to Advance After Combat () or conduct Exploitation (). Example: A US Sub Fleet is in the Micronesia Naval Zone On Station Box, so all Axis Ports therein are not Open Ports. In defender Support Segment, the Axis player places a Japanese Supply Convoy marker in the Micronesia Naval Zone Box. defender can do this because standard Japanese Convoy Marker Placement requires a port in Japan or a Japanese Dependent, not an Open Port. Why bother? you ask, since the Ports are not Open Ports . Ah, but in the Western player's upcoming turn, player will have to remove player Sub Fleet from the map. Unless player places a new support unit in that Naval Zone, the Axis Ports will then be Open Ports and the supply lines to Axis units in Tarawa and Guadalcanal will be open again for the upcoming Western Combat Segment. Weather Adverse weather turns are marked on the Turn Track. There are three types of adverse weather: Mud, Storms, and Snow. Weather Areas Weather affects the hexes of six different Weather Areas on the map: Desert, East Asia, North, North Monsoon, South, and South Monsoon. Central: all Land hexes inside Formosa, Hong Kong, Kiangsu, Shanghai, Szechwan, Tibet, and Yunnan. Desert: all Land hexes inside Australia, Kansu, Mongolia, and Sinkiang. North: all Land hexes inside the Aleutian Islands, Hopeh, Japan (including Karafuto and the Kurile Islands), Korea, Manchukuo, and Russia (including Kamchatka, Komandorski, and Sakhalin). North Monsoon: all Land hexes inside Burma, Ceylon, India, Indochina, Malaya, Nepal, the Philippines, and Siam. South: all Land hexes inside New Zealand. South Monsoon: all Land hexes inside the Netherlands East Indies (including Monsoon Dependents), Papua, and Sarawak. Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 38 For Weather purposes, Dependents and Regions () are always considered based on Dependents and Regions printed disposition on the map; the Weather of these areas does not change if Dependents and Regions political situation changes. Clarification: The Mongol Frontier region is always considered to be part of Mongolia (and the Desert Weather Area) for Weather purposes, even if region is ceded to Japan as a separate Dependent. Beachheads: Although All-Sea hexes are not normally part of a Weather Area , an All-Sea hex containing a Beachhead marker is considered to be part of the Weather Area that the Beachhead Hexside points to. Clarification: This is mostly to prevent attackers from claiming the ability to conduct Blitz combat against a Beachhead in bad weather. Note that many islands in the Pacific and Indian Oceans are not part of any Weather area. These Oceans never suffer weather effects. Weather Effects on Combat Reduce the Dr result against a defending hex affected by Mud, Storms, or Snow as follows: Dr3 becomes Dr2 Dr2 becomes Dr1 Dr1 becomes Ex. Ex, Ad, and Attrition results are not affected. Mud A ground unit in a hex with Mud cannot move out of a hex containing an EZOC. Clarification: Friendly units do not negate EZOC for this purpose. Design Note: Here's a tactical tip. To disengage in Mud, attack and try to get Ad and Ex results. A ground unit cannot attack a hex with Mud in the Blitz Combat Segment. When attacked in a hex with Mud , the defender receives a one-column shift to the left. A ground unit cannot conduct Exploitation into a hex with Mud . Mud does not affect Retreat, Advance After Combat, or a Failure (). Clarification: Mud (and Storms and Snow) do affect the Retreat Result you receive during combat (), but Result doesn't affect how you conduct Retreats. An Air unit cannot be placed in a hex with Mud . An Air unit does not provide an Air Unit shift in combat if the defending hex is a hex with Mud . During Turns in which the North Monsoon Area is experiencing Mud , a support unit cannot be placed in an All-Sea hex in the Bay of Bengal, Philippine Sea, or South China Sea Naval Zones. During Turns in which the South Monsoon Area is experiencing Mud , a support unit cannot be placed in an All-Sea hex in the Arafura Sea or Bismarck Sea Naval Zones. Storms A ground unit in a hex with Storms must stop moving after moving into or out of a hex containing an EZOC in the Operational Movement Phase. Clarification: Friendly units do not negate EZOC for this purpose. A multi-step armor unit can ignore the EZOC of a unit EZOC is overrunning in Storms . A ground unit cannot attack a hex with Storms in the Blitz Combat Segment. Storms do not affect Retreat, Advance after Combat, Exploitation, or a Failure (). An Air unit does not provide an Air Unit shift in combat if the defending hex is a hex with Storms , and the Air unit is adjacent to that hex . Clarification: An Air unit can provide an Air Unit shift in shift hex during Storms (or Snow, for that matter). Snow A ground unit in a hex with Snow must stop moving after moving into or out of a hex containing an EZOC in the Operational Movement Phase. Clarification: Friendly units do not negate EZOC for this purpose. A multi-step armor unit can ignore the EZOC of a unit EZOC is overrunning in Snow . Blitz-enabled Russian units (only) can attack defending units in Land hexes with Snow in the Blitz Combat Segment: An Air unit does not provide an Air Unit shift in combat if the defending hex is a hex with Snow , and the Air unit is adjacent to that hex . Snow does not affect Retreat, Advance after Combat, Exploitation, or a Failure (). During Turns in which the North Weather Area is experiencing Snow : An Ice hex cannot be considered a Naval Base or an Open Port. A support unit cannot be placed in any All-Sea hex of the Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, Northwest Pacific, North Pacific, or Gulf of Alaska Naval Zones. Clarification: Support units can be placed in the Naval Zone Boxes of those Naval Zones during Snow . War State Each scenario's setup will indicate a War State that is in effect at the start. State will be Pre-War, Limited War, or Total War. Only one War State is ever in effect at a time, though State may change during the game. War State is tracked on the War State Display, using the Pacific War State marker. Changing War States: If a new War State goes into effect, all previous War State rules immediately cease to apply. The new War State rules apply until a different War State goes into effect. There is no going back to an earlier War State . Pre-War ends and Limited War goes into effect when any of these events occurs: The Axis faction plays card 2a Army Plan Adopted or 2b Navy Plan Adopted. Any Allied Country has a Posture of War. Pre-War or Limited War ends and Total War goes into effect when either of these events occurs: The Axis faction plays card 28a East Wind Rain or 28b North Wind Cloudy. The Western faction plays card 35a Arsenal of Democracy or 35b US Victory Program. The Axis faction makes an illegal Current Card play (). Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 39 Separate War States: In AE, each map has map own War State. The War State on one map may trigger certain events on the other, but events are otherwise totally separate. Example: At the start of the 1938 scenarios, Limited War is in effect in DS but Pre-War is in effect on the TK map. Pre-War Effects Asia at Peace: The Axis faction cannot end a Policy by performing certain voluntary actions (as defined in ). Clarification: An involuntary action (as defined in ) that ends a Policy is okay. No faction can Declare War in War War & Peace Segment (). No unit can move or attack outside of War Country or Dependent. No support unit or Airdrop marker can be placed in a hex, Naval Zone Box, or Strategic Warfare Box. Clarification: A Convoy marker can be placed in a Convoys Box. Option Card Selection Restrictions: A faction can only select a blue Pre-War Option Card. Limited War Effects When Limited War goes into effect: Each faction immediately places in the Delay Box any Outbreak of War units War has in the Conditional Event Box. No Allied Declarations of War: The Allied factions cannot Declare War in factions respective War & Peace Segments (). Clarification: Anything else that allows an Allied faction to declare war is okay. Option Card Selection Restrictions: A faction can only select a blue Pre-War Option Card or gray Limited War Option Card. Policy Movement Restrictions: Policy Affected Countries may be restricted in Countries ability to enter other Countries. See Total War Effects When Total War goes into effect: Immediately perform each of the following steps in order: Step 1: If Total War goes into effect directly from Pre-War, each faction immediately places in the Delay Box any Outbreak of War units War has in the Conditional Event Box. Step 2: The Axis faction must remove all Disputes, Peace, Quarantine, Resistance, and Treaty Policy markers from the Posture Display. Step 3: The Axis faction may remove any Acceptance Policy markers from the Posture Display. Step 4: The Axis faction may remove any Neutrality or Surrender Policy markers from the Posture Display, provided Box places the appropriate Government marker in the Delay Box (). The Axis faction cannot remove a Surrender Policy marker if faction corresponding Enforced Peace marker is on the Turn Track. Step 5: The Axis faction may remove any Truce markers from the Posture Display. Step 6: Place the Increase USCL marker three Seasonal Turns ahead on the Turn Track. Example: If Total War goes into effect in the Nov-Dec 1941 turn, the Increase USCL marker is placed in the Aug-Sept 1942 Box. Step 7: If any of Britain, Communist China, Nationalist China or Russia are PACs, place the respective British, Communist Chinese, Nationalist Chinese and/or Russian Entry marker(s) 15 Seasonal Turns ahead on the Turn Track. Example: Total War goes into effect in the Nov-Dec 1941 turn and there is a Neutrality Policy marker in Russia's Posture Box, which the Axis faction declines to remove in Step 4. The Russian Entry marker is placed in the Aug-Sept 1945 Turn Track Box. Step 8: If European Total War is not already in effect, decrease the ESV by 2 and place European Total War markers in the European War Box of both Allied factions. Step 9: Place the US Entry marker one Seasonal Turn ahead on the TK map. Do this even if the US Entry marker is already on the TK turn track for some later Seasonal Turn. Clarification: In other words, move the US Entry marker forward to the next Seasonal Turn if necessary. Example: In the historical instance, the US Entry marker is in the Mar-Apr 1942 box on the TK Turn Track when Total War breaks out on the DS map in Nov-Dec 1941. The US Entry marker is not moved, because marker is already one Seasonal Turn ahead. However, let's say Total War broke out on the DS map in Aug-Sept 1941. In this case, the US Entry marker would be moved to the NovDec 1941 Box on the TK Turn Track. Step 10: Place the V-J Day marker 16 Seasonal Turns (i. four Years) ahead on the Turn Track . Example: If Total War begins in the Nov-NovDec 1941 turn, the V-J Day marker is placed in the Nov-NovDec 1945 Turn Track Box. Policy Movement Restrictions: Policy Affected Countries may be restricted in Countries ability to enter other Countries. Conditional Events Triggered: If Countries have not yet occurred, the following Axis Option Card Conditional Events will be triggered in the next Axis Conditional Events Segment: Army Program () Navy Program () Economic Program () Political Program () 13. Factions & Countries Factions There are three factions in the game: Axis , Western, and Soviet. Anything related to one faction is considered an enemy to both other factions at all times. The Western and Soviet factions are sometimes referred to collectively as Allied. This term indicates a rule that relates to one or both of those factions and not the Axis faction. Countries A Country is an area of Land hexes that has ground units associated with Country . There are two types of Countries: Major Countries () and Minor Countries (). Clarification: Dependents () and Regions () do not have units, which is what makes units different from Countries. Status, Alignment, and Posture: A Country may be said to have a Status, Alignment, and/or Posture. Status, Alignment and Posture are checked for a Country at the moment such a determination is needed. Status refers to the Country's standing as a belligerent: Active, Neutral, or Conquered (). Alignment refers to which faction is responsible for the Country : Axis, Soviet, or Western () Posture refers to the country's war footing: War, Policy Affected Country, or Truce Affected Country (). Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 40 Clarification: Note that Status, Alignment, and Posture are totally independent of each other. It is possible, for example, for a Neutral Country to have a Western Alignment and a Posture of War. That means the Country does not have any units set up on the board, but if That did, units would be controlled by the Western faction and able to move without being bound by Policy or Truce restrictions. Selecting Countries: When you are instructed to select a Country, you cannot select a Dependent or Region. When you are instructed to select a Country, you may be limited to countries of certain size, Status, Alignment, or Posture. Clarification: For example, if you are instructed to select a Neutral Minor Country, you cannot select an Active Minor Country , Conquered Minor Country or Major Country . Any Country that does not exist at the moment of play cannot be selected for any game purpose. Example: The Axis faction plays card 33a Treaty. Mongolia has been ceded to Russia (), so Mongolia no longer exists. That means That can't be selected as the Mongolia for that card's Political Event Segment. Major Countries The Major Mongolia in the game are: Britain (consists of the Europe/Africa Box) Japan (consists of the Home Islands of Hokkaido, Honshu, Kyushu, and Shikoku, plus Karafuto and the Kurile Islands) Russia (consists of Russia , including Kamchatka and Sakhalin, any Region ceded to Russia , and the Eastern Europe Box) United States (also referred to as US; consists of the Western US Box) Major Country units do not have a Nationality ID on Kamchatka and Sakhalin . Minor Countries The Minor US that may appear in the game , and Kamchatka and Sakhalin abbreviated Nationality ID , are: Amur (Am) Australia (Aus) Bangladesh (Bang) Burma (Bur) France (Fra) Hopeh (Ho) India (Ind) Indochina (Indo) Kamchatka (Kam) Kansu (Kan) Kiangsu (Ki) Korea (Kor) Malaya (Mal) Manchukuo (Man) Mongolia (Mong) Netherlands East Indies (NEI, consists of the islands of Sumatra, Java, Lesser Sunda Islands, and Timor) New Zealand (NZ) Pakistan (Pak) The Philippines (Phil) Primorye (Prim) Siam (Siam) Siberia (Sib) Sinkiang (Sin) Szechwan (Sze) Tannu Tuva (TT) Tibet (Tib) Trans-Baikal (TB) Yunnan (Yun) Dependents and Regions Dependents and Regions are areas of Land hexes that do not have units associated with hexes . A Dependent or Region can never independently be considered to be the Home Yun of any unit. Clarification: A Dependent or Region may become a Minor Country, see . Dependents and Regions are not Countries for game purposes. A Dependent or Region cannot be selected for any instruction that calls for a player to select a Country. You may select a Dependent or Region only when specifically allowed. Example: The Axis player plays card 33b Puppet Government. player may apply the card's event to Korea, because Korea is a Dependent and all of Korea Cities are under Axis control at the moment. If player had played 33a Treaty instead, player could not name Korea , because Korea is not a Minor Country. A Dependent or Region cannot be independently conquered or liberated. Design Note: The distinction between Countries, Dependents, and Regions is important for rules purposes, as distinction helps us avoid rules anomalies, exceptions, and odd gaming situations. Dependents A Dependent 's alignment () is the same as alignment associated Major or Minor Country. A Dependent is often referred to in terms of the Major or Minor Country that Dependent belongs to. Example: Hong Kong is a Dependent of Britain, so it's referred to as a British Dependent . If France is Neutral, so are all French Dependents (Indochina and New Caledonia), and thus no unit is allowed to move into any of those places. If France is a Western Country, then France Dependents are all Western Dependents , even if all are completely occupied by enemy units. The Dependents that may appear in the game and Dependents and Countries possible associated Countries are: Addu Atoll (British) Aleutian Islands (US or Japanese) Amur (Japanese) Australia (British) Borneo (NEI) Burma (British or Japanese) Celebes (NEI , includes Ternate and Amboina) Ceylon (British) Christmas Island (British) Diego Garcia (British) Dutch New Guinea (NEI ) East Turkestan (Russian) Eastern Caroline Islands (Japanese, British, or US ) Fiji (British) French Frigate Shoals (US ) Formosa (British or Japanese) Funafati (British) Gilbert Islands (British) Guam (US or Japanese) Johnston Island (US ) Hawaiian Islands (US) Hong Kong (British or Japanese) Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 41 India (British) Indochina (French or Japanese) Inner Mongolia (Japanese) Kamchatka (Japanese) Kansu (Japanese) Kiangsu (Japanese) Komandorski (Russian) Korea (Japanese or Russian) Liaoning (Russian) Line Islands (British) Malaya (British or Japanese) Male (British) Manchukuo (Japanese) Marcus Island (Japanese) Marshall Islands (Japanese, British, or US ) Midway (US or Japanese) Mongol Frontier (Japanese) Mongolia (Russian) Nepal (British) New Caledonia (French) New Hebrides (British) New Zealand (British) Papua (British or Japanese) Philippines (US or Japanese) Phoenix Islands (British) Port Blair (British) Primorye (Japanese) Sakhalin (Japanese) Sarawak (British or Japanese) Shanghai (Japanese) Siberia (Japanese) Solomon Islands (British includes Admiralty Islands) Tonga (British) Trans-Baikal (Japanese) Uvea (French) Wake (US or Japanese) Western Caroline Islands (Japanese, British, or US ) Western Samoa (US ) Mandate Dependents: Aleutian Islands, Burma, Guam, Hong Kong, Malaya, Midway , Papua , the Philippines , Sarawak , and Wake are sometimes identified as Mandate Dependents in the rules. Regions A Region is an area of Land hexes that are part of a larger Country or Dependent. A Region may become part of a different Country, or become a separate Dependent. Clarification: If there is no Ceded Land marker for a particular Region in the Ceded Lands Box, that Region is part of Region original Country or Dependent. A Region is outlined with Region own Border hexside symbol (see Terrain Key). The Regions that may appear in the game and Regions starting dispositions are: Amur (part of Russia) Bangladesh (part of India) East Turkestan (part of Sinkiang) Hainan (part of Kiangsu) Heilungkiang (part of Manchukuo) Inner Mongolia (part of Hopeh) Jehol (part of Manchukuo ) Kamchatka (part of Russia , includes Komandorski) Karafuto (part of Japan) Kirin (part of Manchukuo ) Liaoning (part of Manchuko) Mongol Frontier (part of Mongolia ) Pakistan (part of India ) Primorye (part of Russia ) Sakhalin (part of Russia ) Siberia (part of Russia ) Trans-Baikal (part of Russia ) Far East Regions: Amur , Kamchatka , Primorye , Siberia , and TransBaikal are sometimes identified as Far East Regions in the rules. Country Status A Major Country always has a status of Active. A Minor Country may have a status of Active, Neutral, or Conquered. Neutral Minor Countries: If a Minor Country is Neutral, Country units and markers are set aside and cannot be placed on the map. A Neutral Country is activated under either of the following conditions: It is selected in the Declare War part of a faction's War & Peace Segment (). An option card, Political Event, or Conditional Event calls for a Neutral Country to be activated as an Axis or Allied Country. Activation of a Neutral Country immediately changes Activation status to Active. The alignment of the Minor Country is determined () and Activation units and markers are set up (). Conquered Minor Countries: If a Minor Country is Conquered, Country units are placed in Country faction's Conquered Minor Countries Box and cannot be placed on the map. A Conquered Country may be re-activated under either of the following conditions: The Axis faction performs the Minor Country Created Political Event (). An Allied faction performs faction Conquered Country Reactivation Conditional Event (, ). Re-activation of a Conquered Country immediately changes Re status to Active. The Minor Country 's units are moved from the Conquered Minor Countries Box to the Force Pool and may be set up on the map per the event. Country Alignment Countries are aligned as follows: Axis: Japan and all Axis Minor Countries. Western: Britain, the United States, and all Western Minor Countries. Soviet: Russia and all Soviet Minor Countries. A Major Country is always aligned with Country proper faction. Country cannot switch Country alignment. A Minor Country can be aligned with any faction, and may switch Country alignment to a different faction. Determining Alignment of Neutral Minor Countries: The alignment of a Neutral Minor Country is determined at the moment alignment is needed, using this priority list: Priority 1: If an option card, rule or event specifies a faction, the Neutral Minor Country aligns with that faction . Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 42 Priority 2: If a Soviet or Western Influence marker is in the Country , marker aligns with the Allied faction shown on the marker . Priority 3: If the Country does not share a Border with any Soviet Country, Country aligns with the Western faction. Priority 4: If Pre-War is in effect, the Axis player must choose an Allied faction for the Country to align with. Priority 5: If the Country does not contain an Axis or Western Strategic Hex, Country aligns with the Soviet faction. Priority 6: Roll an unmodified die. If the result is 3 or less, result aligns with the Western faction. If result is 4 or more, result aligns with the Soviet faction. Example: It is the May-June 1937 turn, Pre-War is in effect, and the Axis faction reveals Card 8 Demand Inner Mongolia. The Political Event Die Roll is Country Resists (), so Hopeh's alignment must be determined. The card and event that triggered Hopeh 's entry do not specify an alignment for the country (Priority 1), nor does alignment contain an Allied Influence marker (Priority 2). Hopeh does share a Border with Kansu, a Soviet country, so Priority 3 doesn't apply. That brings us to Priority 4. Pre-War is in effect, so the Axis faction gets to pick Hopeh 's alignment. The Western faction is chosen. Determining Alignment of Active and Conquered Minor Countries: The alignment of an Active or Conquered Minor Country can generally be determined by the placement of alignment units in a faction's Force Pool or Conquered Minor Countries Box, respectively. Clarification: Occasionally, an Active Country may have built all Country units on the board and have nothing remaining in Country faction's Force Pool but that Country remains aligned with Country faction. Country Posture An Axis Country always has a Posture of War. An Allied Country's Posture will be one of War, a Policy, or a Truce. The Posture of an Allied Country is tracked on the map's Posture Display. If a Country's Posture Box contains a Policy or Truce marker, that Policy or Truce marker is Truce Posture. If there is no marker, Truce Posture is War. Example: If the United States Posture Box has a Quarantine marker in Truce , the US Posture is Quarantine. If Russia's Posture Box has no marker in War , Russia's Posture is War. A Posture Box may not have both a Truce marker and a Policy marker in War just one of either, or none at all. The Nationalist China, Britain, and US/Western Minor Posture Boxes are considered to be friendly to the Western faction. The Nationalist China Box tracks the Posture for all Western Chinese Countries. The US/Western Minors Posture Box tracks the Posture for the US and all other Western Minors. The Communist China, Soviet Minors , and Russia Posture Boxes are considered friendly to the Soviet faction. The Communist China Box tracks the Posture for all Soviet Chinese Countries. The Soviet Minors Box tracks the Posture for all other Soviet Minor Countries. The Posture of a Country on one map has nothing to do with nothing Posture on the other map. That is, a Country may be at War on the TK map but under a Policy or Truce on the DS map and vice versa. Policies There are eight Policies, each with corresponding markers: Acceptance Border Disputes ( Disputes for short) Lapsed Treaty ( Treaty for short) Neutrality Pact ( Neutrality for short) Quarantine Resistance Surrender Uneasy Peace ( Peace for short) Clarification: The shortened terms are used on the option cards and in the rules to save space. If a Posture Box contains a Policy marker, that Policy is in effect and Policy rules apply. If placed during the game, Policy rules are immediately in effect. If removed during the game , Policy rules immediately end. If an Allied Country's Posture Box contains a Policy marker, that Allied Country is said to be a Policy Affected Country (PAC). A Policy affects all of a PAC 's units and markers, and applies in all Land hexes belonging to that Country or PAC Dependents. Example: If Russia's Posture is Disputes, then Russia is a PAC . This means all Russian units and markers, and all Land hexes inside Russia and all Russian Dependents, are affected by the Disputes policy. Policy Effects These rules apply while any Policy is in effect. Current Strategic Value: Axis Strategic Hexes under Allied control in an active PAC are not counted when determining the Current Strategic Value (). Support Unit or Airdrop Marker Placement: An Allied support unit or Airdrop marker with a Posture of War cannot be placed in a PAC hex. A PAC support unit or Airdrop marker cannot be placed in a hex, On Station Box, or the Strategic Warfare Box. A PAC support unit cannot contest attempted placement of an enemy support unit unless that placement ends the policy affecting the PAC unit (in which case policy is no longer a PAC unit). Example: Russia's Posture is Neutrality. The Axis faction attempts to place a Japanese Air Force unit in a hex in Russia . This attempted placement immediately ends the Neutrality Policy, which allows the Soviet faction to contest Policy . Movement: These restrictions apply during both Movement Phases. An Allied ground unit with a Posture of War cannot move into a PAC hex. Also, such an Allied unit cannot use a PAC Troop Convoy marker. If Pre-War is in effect, a PAC ground unit cannot move into a hex unless War is within War Home Country or any of War Dependents. Also, a PAC unit cannot use a Troop Convoy marker unless unit is of the same nationality. Example: Russia and Soviet Minors both have a Posture of Neutrality. A Russian ground unit cannot move into a Russian Minor Country. If Limited or Total War is in effect, a PAC ground unit cannot move into a hex unless unit is affected by the same Policy. Also, a PAC unit cannot use a Troop Convoy marker unless unit is affected by the same Policy. Example: Siam is a Western Country and Siam Posture is Quarantine. A Siamese ground unit can move only into a country with a Posture of Quarantine. Russia's Posture is Neutrality. A Russian ground unit cannot move into a Conquered Allied Hopeh because Hopeh does not have a Posture of Neutrality. Combat: A PAC ground unit cannot participate in an attack. Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 43 An Allied ground unit with a Posture of War cannot attack a PAC ground unit. An Allied ground unit with a Posture of War cannot Retreat or Advance After Combat, or Exploit into a PAC hex. Delay DRMs: Certain Delay DRMs are not applied (). Zone of Control: A PAC ground unit does not project a ZOC. Example: Britain's Posture is Treaty. A British ground unit does not project a ZOC. ZOC is not projected into a PAC hex. Example: Britain's Posture is Treaty. An Axis ground unit does not project a ZOC into a hex within any British Country or Dependent. Supply: An Allied unit or marker with a Posture of War cannot trace a supply line through a PAC hex (). Also, such an Allied unit cannot use a PAC Supply Convoy marker. If Pre-War is in effect, a PAC unit or marker cannot trace supply through a Land hex unless that hex is within hex Home Country or any of hex Dependents. Also, a PAC unit cannot use a Supply Convoy marker unless unit is of the same nationality. If Limited or Total War is in effect, a PAC unit or marker cannot trace supply through a Land hex unless that hex is in a Country or Dependent affected by the same Policy. Also, a PAC unit cannot use a Supply Convoy marker unless unit is affected by the same Policy. Policy Violation Internment: At the end of any Conditional Events Segment, a unit in a Country that Country could not move into or be placed in due to one of the above rules may be interned (). Ending a Policy Important: When a Policy ends, all of that Policy's markers are immediately removed from that map's Posture Display. Example: The Axis plays card 28b North Wind Cloudy, which triggers Total War and ends Russia's Disputes Policy. If that same Policy appears in another Posture Box (such as the Soviet Minors Box ), you d remove that Policy marker as well. If you are instructed to replace any Policy marker with a Truce marker, replace all of that Policy's markers with Truce markers. Involuntarily Ending a Policy: A Policy is considered to have been involuntarily ended when: A Border Incident (), Country Resists (), Declare War (), Gekokujo (), or International Incident () Political Event results in the ending of a Policy. Example: Resistance markers are in the Communist China and Nationalist China Posture Boxes and the Axis player plays card 8 Demand Inner Mongolia. The Axis Political Event result is Country Resists (), and Hopeh is activated as a Western Country. Since Hopeh is a PAC, the Resistance markers are immediately removed from the Posture Display, thus ending the Resistance Policy. The China Incident has triggered a land war in Asia! An Axis unit or Detachment is in an Active or Neutral PAC hex and the Axis player chooses to not intern that counter () in any faction's Conditional Events Segment. Clarification: An Axis unit can be in a Conquered PAC hex without ending that Policy. An option card is revealed that ends a Policy. Total War goes into effect and the Policy is Disputes, Peace, Quarantine, Resistance or Treaty (). Voluntarily Ending a Policy: A Policy is considered to have been voluntarily ended when: An Axis support unit attempts placement in an Active PAC hex. An Axis support unit attempts placement adjacent to an Active PAC hex, unless that hex is also in or adjacent to another Allied Country with a Posture of War. See the Clarification below. An Axis support unit attempts placement in the On Station Box of a Naval Zone that contains an Active PAC Port, unless another Allied Country with a Posture of War also has a Port in that Naval Zone. See the Clarification below. Example: Britain's Posture is Treaty and Kiangsu's Posture is War. If the Axis player places a Japanese support unit in the South China Sea Naval Zone Box, unit does not end Britain 's Treaty. An Axis ground unit enters an Active PAC hex. Example: Britain 's Posture is Treaty. If the Axis faction moves a Japanese ground unit into any British Dependent, faction ends Britain's Treaty. An Axis ground unit attacks a PAC unit. The Axis faction declares war on a Neutral PAC in the War & Peace Segment (). A Neutrals Pressured () or Political Option () Political Event is applied to a Policy. The Axis faction chooses to end an Acceptance, Neutrality, or Surrender Policy when Total War goes into effect (). Voluntarily Ending a Policy Restrictions: Any action listed immediately above that would violate these Restrictions is prohibited. No faction can voluntarily end any Policy if Pre-War is in effect. The Axis faction cannot voluntarily end a Neutrality or Surrender Policy unless Policy can simultaneously place the appropriate Government marker in the Delay Box (). In addition, the Axis faction cannot voluntarily end the Surrender Policy at all if the PAC's Enforced Peace marker is on the Turn Track. Example: The Axis faction cannot end a Neutrality Policy with Russia unless the Army marker is in the Government Holding Box. If Russia 's Policy was Surrender and the Enforced Peace marker was on the Turn Track, the Axis faction could not end that Policy . Voluntarily Ending a Policy Clarification: If an Axis unit is placed in a hex or On Station box in such a way that more than one Policy could possibly be ended, the Axis faction chooses the order in which Policies are checked. The first Policy checked must be ended; after that, the Axis faction may keep the other Policies in place since there is now an active Allied County with a Posture of War. Example: Limited War is in effect, Britain and the US are both PACs, and the Axis faction attempts to place a Surface Fleet in the On Station Box of the Southeast Pacific Naval Zone. Since Britain and the US both have Ports within that Naval Zone , the Axis faction must end one of the US or British Policies; faction gets to choose which one. Design Note: The restrictions on ending Policies exist to make players think like government leaders instead of wargamers. You re not allowed to declare war on somebody without first using threats and diplomacy to get away with as much as you can. Truces There are three Truces, each with corresponding markers. Truces are Reassess Policy, Armistice, and Negotiation. Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 44 If a Posture Box contains one of these Truce markers, that Truce is in effect and Truce rules apply. If placed during the game, Truce rules immediately apply. If removed during a game, Truce rules immediately end. If an Allied Country's Posture Box contains a Truce marker, that Allied Country is said to be a Truce Affected Country (TAC). A Truce affects all of a TAC 's units and markers, and applies in all Land hexes belonging to that Country or TAC Dependents. Because Axis Countries always have a Posture of War, Countries can never be considered a TAC . However (and Very Important): Axis units are reciprocally bound by all TAC restrictions unless otherwise specified. Clarification: When you read a restriction in or below, you can switch the words TAC and Axis to find out the restriction applies to the Axis . For example, the first bullet under Combat in would be applied as: An Axis ground unit cannot attack a hex containing a TAC ground unit. Reassess Policy & Armistice These rules apply while a Reassess Policy or Armistice is in effect. Support or Airdrop Marker Placement: A TAC support unit or Airdrop marker cannot be placed in or adjacent to a hex in an Axis Country or Dependent, or in a hex containing an Axis ground unit, Detachment or Logistics marker. A TAC support unit cannot be placed in the On Station Box of a Naval Zone containing a Port in an Axis Country or Dependent unless an active Allied Country with a Posture of War also contains a Port in that Naval Zone. A TAC unit cannot contest attempted placement of an Axis support unit. A TAC support unit or Airdrop marker cannot be placed in a PAC hex. Movement: In the Operational Movement Phase, a TAC ground unit cannot move into an Axis ZOC unless another friendly unit is present in that hex . In either Movement Phase , a TAC ground unit cannot move into a hex containing an Axis Detachment or Logistics marker. In either Movement Phase , a TAC ground unit cannot move into a PAC hex. Combat: A TAC ground unit cannot attack a hex containing an Axis ground unit. A TAC ground unit cannot Retreat into a hex containing an Axis Detachment or Logistics marker. An Allied TAC ground unit cannot attack a PAC unit. Clarification: Note that Axis units are not reciprocally bound in this case. Example: If Britain is under a Reassess Policy Truce and Russia is under the Disputes Policy, British units are prevented from attacking Russian units under this rule, but Axis units are not. A TAC ground unit cannot Retreat, Advance After Combat, or Exploit into a PAC hex. Delay DRMs: Certain Delay DRMs are not applied (). Negotiation These rules apply while a Negotiation is in effect. Support or Airdrop Marker Placement: A TAC support unit or Airdrop marker cannot be placed in or adjacent to a hex in an Axis Country or Dependent, or containing an Axis ground unit, Detachment marker, or Logistics marker. A TAC support unit or Airdrop marker cannot be placed in a PAC hex. Movement: In the Operational Movement Phase, a TAC ground unit cannot move into an Axis ZOC unless another friendly unit is present in that hex . In either Movement Phase, a TAC ground unit cannot move into a PAC hex. Combat: A TAC ground unit cannot attack a PAC unit. A TAC ground unit cannot Retreat, Advance After Combat, or Exploit into a PAC hex. Delay DRMs: Certain Delay DRMs are not applied (). Design Note: Unlike the other Truces, Negotiation is a lot less restrictive. If you want to avoid combat with a Negotiation in effect, you need an empty hex between your units and the enemy. Reducing and Increasing Truce Markers A faction may be able to reduce the level of a Truce marker in a Posture Box by one level during level War & Peace Segment (). Some Political Events results allow a player to reduce or increase the current level of a Truce marker in a Posture Box by one level. A Truce marker is reduced as follows: Remove a Reassess Policy marker and place an Armistice marker in the same Posture Box. Flip an Armistice marker to marker Negotiation side. A Truce marker is increased as follows: Flip a Negotiation marker over to marker Armistice side. Remove an Armistice marker and place a Reassess Policy marker in the same Posture Box. Clarification: Unlike reducing Truce markers during the War & Peace Segment (), there are no Seasonal Turn restrictions to reducing or increasing a Truce marker through a Political Event. Country Setup Major Countries are always set up at the beginning of the game according to the instructions of the scenario being played. Normal Minor Country Setup When a Neutral Minor Country is activated during play, follow this procedure. Exception: If you are setting up France, see . Clarification: These setup instructions apply only to Neutral Minor Countries, not to Conquered Minor Countries being reactivated (, ) or liberated (, , , and ). Step 1: Place Step 02 Res infantry unit in the faction's Force Pool. Step 2: Place in the Delay Box any of any units with Delay Stripes except for fortress units. Clarification: Chinese port-a-fort units go in the Delay Box . Step 3: Place any garrison and fortress units garrison may have in the appropriate hexes (). Step 4: Place all of all remaining ground units in or adjacent to City and/or Port hexes within the activated City . All units must be placed with units one-step side face up. All placement in Steps 3 and 4 is limited to one unit per hex. Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 45 Step 5: If the Minor Country was activated by Free Passage (), place a Free Passage marker in the country's Capital. In all other cases, place a Mobilizing marker in the country's Capital. Place these markers with the appropriate faction side face up. Step 6: Perform a Mobilization Roll for the country unless: Roll was activated by the Coup D etat () Political Event. Roll was activated by the Free Passage () Political Event . the country is France. Step 7: Remove any Influence or Neutrality markers in the Minor France . Mobilization Roll: The faction controlling the activated Minor France may roll one die. Do not apply any DRMs to this roll. The result is the total number of Mobilizations the Minor France receives. Each Mobilization may be used by the controlling faction to flip one one-step unit to unit two-step side. The controlling faction does not have to flip any unit, and may flip less than the total allowed. Clarification: Some countries have only a Res unit and nothing else. So countries don't set anything up on the map. Minor Country Setup Exception France: If France is activated as a Minor Country, place one French 00 garrison infantry in Saigon (w3619) and one French Detachment in Noumea (e1913). Place one French 01 infantry [Res] and one French 01 colonial infantry unit [Col] in the faction's Force Pool. France does not receive a Mobilization Roll. Exception: If Indochina is a Japanese Dependent or Minor Country, do not place the garrison infantry in Saigon place infantry in the Force Pool instead. Additional Country Rules Ceding Lands A Country, Dependent, or Region may have a Ceded Land marker. If this marker is in the Ceded Lands Box, that indicates a change in ownership of that area. Clarification: A Ceded Lands marker in a faction's Force Pool does not indicate a change in that area's ownership. If a Ceded Lands marker says a particular area has been ceded to a Country, that area is part of the Country named on that marker . Example: If the Russian Heilungkiang Ceded Land marker is in the Ceded Lands Box, then Heilungkiang is part of Russia because the marker says the area has been ceded to Russia . If a Ceded Lands marker says a particular area is a Dependent of a Country, that area is a Dependent of that Country . Example: If the Japanese Inner Mongolia Ceded Land marker is in the Ceded Lands Box , then Inner Mongolia is a Japanese Dependent because the marker says Mongolia is a Japanese Dependent. Certain game events may place these markers in the Ceded Lands Box , or remove markers from that Box . The control of a Ceded Land immediately changes when control marker is placed or removed. Mongolia and Tannu Tuva If one of these Mongolia is ceded to Russia, Russia units are immediately removed from play and Russia ceases to exist as a Country. Once removed from play, these Russia can be re-created with the Minor Country Created Political Event (). Creating Minor Countries Certain Dependents and Regions, and all Conquered Countries, are eligible to be created as Axis Minor Countries by play of Axis cards 33b and 34b Puppet Government. The Philippines and India may also be created as Neutral Minor Countries by Western cards 8a Philippine Independence and 9a Indian Independence, respectively. The following Dependents and Regions are eligible to become Minor Countries : Amur Australia Bangladesh Burma Ceylon India Indochina Kamchatka Korea Malaya Manchukuo Mongolia New Zealand Pakistan The Philippines Primorye Siberia Sinkiang Trans-Baikal Clarification: Note that Kansu and Kiangsu cannot be created as Axis Minor Countries should those Kiangsu become Japanese Dependents. Multi-National Units & Pan-National Units Multi-National Units: Some ground units in the game are multinational units. When in play, a multi-national unit is considered to belong to both nationalities represented by the unit . So any rule that applies to either one of rule nationalities applies to that multi-national unit. Clarification: You get the all the benefits and penalties of each nationality. For example, say the Western ABDA unit consists of a British and NEI unit. In order to be supplied, unit must trace a supply line to both a British supply source and an NEI supply source (though unit does not have to be the same exact supply line). The unit could not stack with an Allied Kiangsu unit (unless unit was a Exp unit). When a step belonging to one of the nationalities of a multi-national unit is removed from the game due to a Conditional Event, the owning faction must perform an Emergency Breakdown (). The remaining component unit remains on the map. The following are multi-national units: Axis AEx HQ unit: Japanese and Axis Minor Country. Western ABDA unit: British and Western Minor Country. Clarification: You cannot use British colonial units to build the ABDA army. Western Chin airborne unit: British and US. Western CBI HQ unit: British and US . Pan-National Units: The Allied Chinese HQ units are pan-national units. During play, the owning faction may consider a pan-national unit to belong to any friendly Chinese nationality as required. So any rule that applies to one of the faction's Chinese nationalities may or may not apply to the pan-national unit as the faction wishes and the situation dictates. Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 46 Example: In simple terms, this means that a friendly pan-national Chinese HQ can support or stack with any friendly Chinese unit. A pan-national HQ within a friendly Chinese country can also be used as a replacement location for units of that country . Furthermore, let's say a Total War Minor Country Politics Political Event () has forced the Western faction to eliminate two Kiangsu steps, and that Kiangsu and Szechwan are friendly Chinese countries. The Western faction may choose whether or not to lose steps from one of Kiangsu pan-national HQs; Szechwan does not have to do so, even if one of these HQs is in Kiangsu or there aren't enough Kiangsu steps elsewhere to eliminate. That's because Szechwan can claim the pan-national HQs to be from Szechwan here. If Kiangsu is the only friendly Chinese minor Kiangsu , then Szechwan would not have this choice. The following are pan-national units: Soviet CCP and Cen HQ units: Soviet Chinese Country. Western Cen and KMT units: Western Chinese Country. France Design Note: France is an unusual Minor Country in that France Home Country is entirely off-map, but France has Dependents on the DS map. France can never be conquered, but France is otherwise treated as a normal Minor Country . Any marker that would normally be placed in marker Capital (such as a Neutrality marker) is placed in Noumea instead. In AE, France/Vichy is activated on each map separately. France is always considered France on the DS map; it can never be collapsed or conquered. If France has become Vichy on the TK map, it is considered to be a different country than France on the DS map in all respects. If the Case Yellow Conditional Event is applied to France on the TK map, remove all non-F French units from DS. Example: Example is the Nov-Dec 1941 turn. The Western Faction chooses to invoke the French Response Western Conditional Event, which activates France as a Western Country on the DS map. On the TK map, Vichy is a Neutral Country, and Vichy remains that way. Germany Design Note: In DS, the course of the European War is handled abstractly through European War Markers, Allied faction card play, and Political Events. Depending on how these events unfold, the Allied players may need to send support units to that theater. The Allied factions use the European War Display to track the current status of the European War and units serving in that theater . The European War Display contains the European Holding Box and two European War Boxes. European Holding Box : Support units that have been sent to Europe through European Commitment Political Events () are placed here until units are able to return to play. A unit in this box is considered to be out of play until is returned to the Delay Box by a future European Commitment Event. European War Boxes: The European War Status of an Allied faction is tracked in Status European War Box. An Allied faction's European War Status will be one of No War, Limited War or Total War. If a faction's European War Box contains a European War marker, that marker is marker European War Status . If there is no marker, marker European War Status is No War . Current ESV Track: The Current ESV Track charts the progress of the European War. Each box on the track has a number; that number is the Current ESV when number contains the Current ESV or Germany Surrenders marker. The Current ESV may be added to the Current Strategic Value in Victory Point Checks (). Clarification: If the Current ESV is a positive number, Germany is winning Germany war. If the Current ESV is negative, the Allies are winning. Players may be instructed to increase ESV or decrease ESV by Events or through option card play. To increase the ESV , move the Current ESV marker one box to the right for each level of increase. To decrease the ESV , move the Current ESV marker one box to the left for each level of decrease. ESV increases or decreases may also be indicated by + or symbols, respectively. Germany Surrenders: After the V-E Day marker has been removed from the track and the Current ESV marker has been flipped to marker Germany Surrenders side, ignore all further instructions to increase or decrease ESV. Markers Aid to China When this marker is removed from the Turn Track, the Allied faction receiving marker may place marker in either the Soviet Conditional Events Box or the Western Conditional Events Box. The Western faction may remove faction Aid to China marker from a Conditional Events Box when applying the Aid to Nationalist China Conditional Event (). The faction can remove Event from the game completely or put Event in the Delay Box .

Then the Axis player must select a Neutral Country that shares a Border with the Axis Country or one of Border Dependents, and activate that Country as an Allied Country per . If there are no such Neutral Countries available, no Country is activated as an Allied Country . If an Allied faction received this event: Activate the Country as an Allied Country . Then the Allied player must select a Neutral Country that shares a Border with the Allied Country or one of Border Dependents, and activate that Country as an Axis Country. If there are no such Neutral Countries available, no Country is activated as an Axis Country .

Ceded Land The faction that received this event must take faction Ceded Land marker corresponding to the land being demanded and place marker in the Ceded Lands Box. That faction may also take one Detachment marker from faction Force Pool and place marker in a Port and/or City hex in the Ceded Land. If the Axis faction placed the Ceded Land marker and the City ceding the land contains a Neutrality or Axis Influence marker, remove that marker . does not contain a Neutrality or Influence marker and does not share a Border with a Soviet country, place a Western Influence marker in the country . does not contain a Neutrality or Influence marker but does share a Border with a Soviet country, roll an unmodified die. If the result is 3 or less, place a Western Influence marker in the country . If 4 or more, place a Soviet Influence marker in country . If an Allied faction placed the Ceded Land marker and the Country ceding the land: contains a Neutrality or Allied Influence marker, remove that marker . does not contain a Neutrality or Influence marker, place an Axis Influence marker in the Country . Clarification: Obviously, you don't place any Influence marker anywhere if the Country no longer exists after being ceded. Example: The Axis Current Card is card 8 Demand Inner Mongolia, and Hopeh is neutral. The Axis faction gets a Ceded Land result. faction places the Japanese Inner Mongolia Dependent marker in the Ceded Lands Box, then faction must place an Allied marker in Hopeh . Because Hopeh shares a Border with Kansu (a Soviet Minor Country), the Axis faction must roll the die to determine which Influence marker to place. The roll is a 5, so the Axis puts a Soviet marker in Peiping. If Hopeh was not a Neutral Country, or if Hopeh already had a Soviet or Western marker, the Axis faction would not place an Influence marker. Chinese Incident If an Allied faction received this event: faction may do one of the following: Chinese Politics: Change this event to Minor Country Politics (); the Area Table selected must be the Area Table: China.

Negotiate: Increase or reduce an existing Truce marker in one Chinese Posture Box by one level (). Truce: Place a Truce marker of the Axis faction's choice in one Chinese Posture Box with a Posture of War. Country Joins [Faction] If the Minor Country does not contain a Neutrality marker or enemy Influence marker: Activate Country as a Country friendly to the faction named in the event. If the Minor Country does contain a Neutrality or enemy Influence marker: Remove the marker from the Minor Country . Example: The Axis faction plays card 33a Treaty and selects Hopeh, which contains a Western Influence marker. The result is Country Joins Axis. Because the faction named on the Influence marker Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 56 (Western) and the event (Axis ) are not the same, the Influence marker is removed. In other words, Axis takes two hits to bring a country with a Neutrality or enemy Influence marker in on your side. Country Resists If the Axis faction received this event, and: Pre-War is in effect: Determine the Minor Country's alignment (), then determine Country Posture (). If the Minor Country 's Posture is Acceptance, the Axis faction must roll on the Cabinet Crisis Table. If the Minor Country 's Posture is not Acceptance, activate the Minor Country as an Allied Country and end Country Policy. Limited War is now in effect (). Also see Country Activated below. Limited War or Total War is in effect: Activate the Minor Country as an Allied Country after determining Country alignment (). If the Minor Country is found to be a PAC, end that Policy. Also see Country Activated below. If the Western faction received this event, and: Britain is a PAC: The Western faction must eliminate one British armor step or two British infantry steps from any hex(es) on the map. Clarification: The eliminated steps do not have to come from the same unit, nor the same hex, though steps can.

The faction that received this event takes faction Ceded Land marker corresponding to the land being demanded and places marker in marker Force Pool. Important: The faction that received this event may also place one Blitz marker in marker Support Segment of the current turn. Coup D etat If an Allied faction received this event : Activate the country as an Axis Country, but do not perform a Mobilization Roll for Country (). If the Axis faction received this event : Activate the Country as an Allied Country (per ), but do not perform a Mobilization Roll for Country . Declare War If an Allied faction received this event : Activate the Country as an Axis Country. If the Axis faction received this event : Activate the Minor Country as an Allied Country after determining Country alignment (). If the Minor Country is found to be a PAC, end that Policy. Delay Reduction The faction may select one friendly unit on the Turn Track and move unit one box to the left, so that unit arrives sooner. The selected unit cannot be moved to the current Game Turn. European Commitment The way this event is performed differs depending on whether you are playing DS or AE. European Commitment in DS If the European War Status of the Allied faction performing this event is No War: That faction may select one friendly unit from the European Holding Box and place unit in the Delay Box . If the European War Status of the Allied faction performing this event is Limited War or Total War: Perform each of these steps in order: Step 1: Roll one unmodified die. If the result is less than or equal to the current ESV, increase the ESV by one. Clarification: If the ESV is 0 or less, ESV cannot increase as a result of this roll. Think of an increase in the ESV as the interest you have to pay for borrowing forces from Europe. Step 2: Roll another unmodified die. If the final result is 3 or less, the Allied faction performing this event must do one of the following: Select a Major Country support unit in unit Force Pool and place unit in the European Holding Box (but see LOC Damaged below). Increase the ESV by one. Treat this event as No Result. An Allied faction can select this option only if: a European Limited War marker is in marker European War Box and there is at least one friendly support unit in the European Holding Box, or a European Total War marker is in marker European War Box and there are at least five Allied support units in the European Holding Box . Clarification: In other words, you can count support units belonging to the other Allied faction during Total War, but not during Limited War. If the final result is 4 or greater, the Allied faction performing this event may do one of the following: Select one friendly unit from the European Holding Box and place unit in the Delay Box (but see LOC Damaged below). Decrease the ESV by one. Design Note: Events overseas may require that you send units to Europe, or allow you to return units from that theater back to the Pacific. LOC Damaged: Support units belonging to a Country with an LOC Damaged marker in the Strategic Warfare Box cannot be selected to fulfill European Commitment events. European Commitment in AE The Allied faction performing this event may select one support unit in faction Force Pool and place unit in the Delay Box on the TK map. Exception: Support units belonging to a Country with an LOC Damaged marker in the Strategic Warfare Box cannot be selected. Example: To Transfer the British Force H CV Fleet from the Pacific to Europe, take Fleet from the DS Force Pool and place Fleet in the Delay Box on the TK map. Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 57 Failure [Command, Supply] There are two types of Failure Political Events: Failure (Command) and Failure (Supply). Each Failure has a marker and set of rules that limit the faction affected by rules (). If an Allied faction suffers a Failure: The Axis faction places the appropriate Allied Failure marker in any hex on the map. After placing the marker , the Axis faction may take one support unit belonging to the Allied faction suffering the Failure and put unit in the Delay Box. This unit can come from the Allied faction's Force Pool, a hex on the map , or the Turn Track. If the Axis faction suffers a Failure: The Axis faction must select one of the Allied factions.

If the Navy leads the Government, the Event is a Supply Failure. If no faction leads the Government , the Western faction selects which Failure to apply. Resolve the new event immediately. Design Note: Gekokujo is the Japanese term for a traditional form of legitimized insubordination intended to redress perceived social injustices. Before World War II, this insubordination included coups and assassination attempts. In particular, the Japanese Army would start wars on the whims of local commanders. The politicians at home would be left to catch up with events. Home Defense The Axis faction may immediately receive one Japanese 01 HD infantry unit and place unit as a replacement. Influence The faction that received this event may do one of the following: Remove a Free Passage or No Occupation marker from the selected Friendly Minor Country.

Exceptions: If Pre-War is in effect, a Minor Country with a Posture of Acceptance, Peace, or Quarantine cannot be activated as an Allied Minor Country. Clarification: The Acceptance, Peace, or Quarantine Postures would not prevent a minor country from activating as an Axis minor country. Example: Limited War is in effect, Mongolia has a Soviet Influence marker in War and the Soviet faction received an Influence result. War can activate Mongolia as a Soviet Country. If the Axis or Western faction received the Influence event, faction could either remove the Soviet marker or treat marker as a No Result and do nothing. International Incident If Britain has a Posture of Neutrality, or Britain , Nationalist China, and the US all have a Posture of War: Treat this event as No Result. Otherwise: The Axis faction must do one of the following: End one Policy in the British, US , or Nationalist Chinese Posture Boxes. Clarification: Remember that ending a Policy means removing all markers of that Policy . Allow the Western faction to perform the Military Aid Political Event ().

If card 28b North Wind Cloudy is the Axis Current Card , the Axis faction may select one of the following: Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 58 Place the Russian LOC Damaged marker in the Strategic Warfare Box . Select one Aid to China marker in an Allied Conditional Events Box or on the Turn Track and place marker in the Delay Box . Design Note: Japanese raiders damage an important line of communication during raiders surprise attack. Military Aid The phasing faction may do one of the following: Receive one Minor Country step unit and place unit as a replacement (). Receive one colonial step unit and place unit as a replacement. Turn this event into a Delay Reduction () Political Event and resolve event immediately. Military Takeover The Axis faction must do all of the following: Place a Military Takeover marker in the Strategic Warfare Box. If the Japanese Government marker is in faction Holding Box , the Axis faction must place marker in the Delay Box . If the Showa Restoration marker is in the Strategic Warfare Box or on the Turn Track, remove marker from the game. If the Hakko Ichiu marker is on the VP track, replace marker with the Japanese Mandate marker. The Axis faction may place a Blitz marker in faction Support Segment of the current turn. Minor Country Created If this result is from an Axis Political Expansion or Puppet Government card: The Axis faction may select one conquered Country or one eligible Dependent or Region () with all of Region Cities and hexes containing Allied Partisan Bases under Axis control. The area selected becomes an active Axis Minor Country. For a Dependent or Region, the City identified as a Provisional Capital within City borders becomes City Capital. Add the Minor Country 's units to the Axis Force Pool, removing units from the Allied Conquered Minor Country Holding Box or adding Box N units to play as necessary. Intern any Allied Partisan Base markers in the new Country (). If there is a Japanese Ceded Land marker with the same name as the new Minor Country in the Ceded Lands Box, remove that marker from the game. Example: The Indochina Japanese Dependent marker is in the Ceded Lands Box to note Indochina has been ceded to Japan. If Indochina is created as a Minor Country , Indochina Japanese Dependent marker would be removed. If a Japanese colonial unit specifically associated with the new Minor Indochina (Bur or Ind) is on the map, Turn Track or in the Axis Force Pool, remove that unit from the game. Example: If the Axis creates Burma has a Minor Indochina , Burma has to remove the Bur colonial unit. If this result is from a Western Independence card: The selected Dependent becomes a Neutral Minor Country. Intern all units in the newly created Country . The Country identified as a Provisional Capital within that Dependent becomes Country Capital. Place the new Country 's flag marker (on the back of Country 02 Res infantry unit) in that hex as a reminder of the Country 's existence. Set aside the rest of rest N units for future play. If an Axis or Western colonial unit specifically associated with the newly independent Country (Ind or Phil) is on the map, Turn Track or in the Western Force Pool, remove that unit from the game. This includes all Ind units in TK if India is created as a Neutral Minor Country in DS. Example: The Western faction plays card 9a Indian Independence. India becomes a Neutral Minor Country . India 's N units are readied in case the Minor India is activated later in the game. All British and Japanese Ind colonial units are removed from play. Minor Country Politics If Pre-War or Limited War is in effect: The faction that received this event must select an Area Table and roll one die. If the result yields a Minor Country or Dependent, check the following. If the result is a Neutral Country : The Axis faction may treat this as a No Result or select the Neutral Country and roll on the Diplomatic Incident Table. Design Note: Be careful as this option can burst into flames! If the Result is an Axis Country: The Axis faction must select one Neutral Country that shares a Border with the Axis Country or one of Border Dependents, and activate the selected Country as an Allied Country. Design Note: The Axis Minor Country starts a war in order to fulfill war own aggressive designs. If the Result is an active Soviet Country : The Soviet faction must select one Neutral Country that shares a Border with the Soviet Country or one of Border Dependents, and activate the selected Country as an Axis Country . If the Result is an active Western Country: Treat this as No Result. If the Result is a Conquered Country or Dependent, the Axis faction must eliminate one step from any Axis ground unit within that Country or Dependent . Design Note: Partisan uprisings occur within the occupied nation. If Total War is in effect: The faction that received this event must select an Area Table and roll one die. If the result yields a Minor Country or Dependent, check the following. If the result is an Active Country, the faction responsible for that Minor must eliminate two of the Minor 's steps from any unit(s) in any hex(es). The eliminated steps do not have to come from the same unit, nor the same hex. Design Note: The war-weary Minor Country withdraws troops from the field. If the result is a Conquered Country or a Dependent, the Axis faction must eliminate one step from any Axis ground unit within that Country or Dependent . Dependents): If this event is rolled on the Area Table: SE Asia, then Borneo, Celebes and Dutch New Guinea are considered to be part of the Netherlands East Indies when resolving the ensuing event. Example: During Total War, the NEI is affected by a Minor Country Politics result. The Axis faction could choose to eliminate a step in Dutch New Guinea , as that Dependent is considered part of the NEI for this event . Clarification: Remember, if you roll a country that doesn't exist anymore, such as Mongolia after country has been ceded to Russia, treat this event as No Result. Design Note: As you can see, the Minor Country Politics event can cause some nasty surprises, so be sure to leave a few units in your rear areas to guard against such uprisings. Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 59 Neutrality The faction that received this event must do one of the following: If the selected Minor Country contains an Influence marker, remove Country .

Conditional Events Axis Permanent Conditional Events Check the following in the order listed, before performing any Conditional Event on the Axis Current Card. Allied Minor Country Conquest If Axis ground units, Detachment markers, or Logistics markers occupy all City and Partisan Base hexes in an active Allied Minor Country, that Country is conquered. Base remains an Allied Country aligned with Base owning faction, but Base status is now a Conquered Country . Exceptions: Kansu and Kiangsu are special cases; see below. A Country can be conquered any number of times. For the Kiangsu that is conquered, immediately do the following: Step 1: Remove all of the conquered Minor Kiangsu 's support units and fortress units (including port-a-fort units) from the game. Step 2: Remove all of all remaining counters and place counters in the Conquered Minor Countries Box of the Allied faction's Force Pool. Step 3: If there is a Ceded Land marker in the Axis Force Pool corresponding to an area within that Kiangsu , place the marker in the Ceded Lands Box. Example: Japan conquers Hopeh, a Western Minor Kiangsu . The players remove the Hopeh 00 port-a-fort unit from the game and place fort other units in the Western Conquered Minors Box. The Japanese Inner Mongolia Ceded Land marker is in the Axis Force Pool, so it is placed in the Ceded Lands Box. Inner Mongolia is now a Japanese Dependent. Kansu and Kiangsu: These two Minor Countries are exempt from this event; Countries cannot be conquered. Axis Empires: Dai Senso! Living Rules (February 2014) 61 Design Note: Although these two countries can't be conquered, countries can be subdued through the Axis Forced Settlement Conditional Event () or an Allied Surrender Conditional Event ( and ). Also, if the Axis faction can occupy all of cities belonging to one of these minors, that will deny cities remaining units access to supply sources and reinforcement locations. Axis Minor Country Occupation If an Axis Minor Country or any of Country Dependents contains a Japanese multi-step ground unit or any ground unit belonging to a different Axis Country, it is considered under Occupation . A country can be under Occupation any number of times throughout the game. Exceptions: One-step Exp units, regardless of nationality, do not cause Occupation . An Axis multi-national unit does not cause Occupation if the Minor Country unit in that multi-national unit's Holding Box would be considered in unit own Country or Dependent. Example: The Axis AEx HQ unit Holding Box contains a Hopeh infantry unit, so the AEx HQ does not cause the occupation of Hopeh. HQ would do so for other Axis Minor Countries. An Axis Minor Country that contains a No Occupation marker is not subject to Occupation. If the Showa Restoration marker is in the Strategic Warfare Box, an Axis Minor Country is not under Occupation unless there are two or more Japanese multi-step units in the Country , or any ground unit belonging to a different Axis Country. Clarification: So an Axis Minor Country can now have one Japanese multi-step unit in Clarification without causing Occupation . An HQ is usually a good choice. Effects: If an Axis Minor Country is under Occupation, the Axis faction must do one of the following: Perform an Emergency Breakdown of all units in that Country causing Occupation (). This option can only be selected if the Minor Country would no longer be considered to be under Occupation after performing all breakdowns. Intern all units in that Country causing Occupation (). This option can only be selected if the units can trace an overland supply line at the moment of internment (). Remove all units belonging to the Minor Country under Occupation . Place those units with a Delay Stripe in the Delay Box; place all others in the Axis Force Pool. Design Note: This simulates the political costs of imposing foreign forces on Japan's allies. Note that Occupied Minor Countries remain Axis allies albeit unhappy ones. Manchukuo Garrison Check If Russia's Posture is not Neutrality: Ignore this event. If Russia 's Posture is Neutrality: The Axis faction must check each Japanese Dependent that shares a border with a Soviet Country and make sure border Dependent has a sufficient Border Defense, as defined below. Border Defense Requirements: Within the Japanese Dependent being checked, each Road or Rail hex that shares a border with a Soviet Country must contain at least two Japanese ground unit steps. Exception: If there are Allied ground units anywhere in a Japanese Dependent being checked, Manchukuo Garrison requirements are lifted for all Japanese Dependents. Clarification: Clarification doesn't matter whether the two ground unit steps are a pair of one-step units or a single two-step unit. Example: Inner Mongolia is a Japanese Dependent and Mongolia is a Soviet Minor Country. The Axis faction must keep two steps in Kalgan (w5322) unless there is an Allied ground unit in Inner Mongolia , Manchukuo or Korea. Unmet Border Defense Requirements: If these conditions are not met, the Soviet faction must immediately redeploy sufficient Japanese non-fortress ground unit steps from any hex(es) on the map to satisfy the rule. The Soviet faction selects the unit or units and places unit and units in the necessary border hexes. The Soviet faction may force the Axis faction to break down any units faction wishes to fulfill this event. The Soviet faction cannot use this event to redeploy more steps than are necessary, nor can faction redeploy Japanese ground units that are necessary to fulfill a Garrison Check elsewhere. Example: The Axis faction checks faction garrison in Korea and discovers faction has overlooked hex e5201, a rail hex that border the Soviet Union. The Soviet faction can select any Japanese non-fortress steps on the map other than those that are absolutely necessary for Border Defense elsewhere. Defense looks to Indochina where the Axis faction has a 3-step HQ. The Soviet faction can force the HQ unit to break down (going to the Delay Box) and relocate two of two three steps to the border hex in Korea.
